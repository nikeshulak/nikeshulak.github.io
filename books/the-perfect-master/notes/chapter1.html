You have to be a disciple first; you have to fulfill that requirement. And what is
the requirement of a disciple? Prayerfulness is the requirement of disciple hood . Capacity to wait.
Capacity to be empty. Capacity to surrender. Capacity to be available. That’s what prayer is! And
if you know how to pray, you will know all that is needed to know. Not only will you come across a
Perfect Master – you are going to come across God himself.

How can you pray to God? You don’t know God – that’s why you are praying. You would like to know
what God is, but you don’t know. That’s why you are pouring your heart out. It is waiting for the
unknown to take possession of you. This is faith, this is trust.
The skeptical mind wants first to be certain whether there is a God: ”Then I will pray.” Rilke is right:
”Oh, but I knew this mowing how far I am from those greedy ones who, before praying, ask whether
God exists.”
”We will pray only if God exists” – then you will never pray, because you will never know without
praying that God exists. You have made an impossible condition for praying. It is not to be fulfilled.

You have to pray. Don’t ask the question whether God exists or not. God is irrelevant at this point.
At this point, make prayer possible.
Prayer is a song of the heart addressed to the unknown. Maybe he is, maybe he is not, but that is
not the point. One is joyous in pouring one’s heart out. It is a joy unto itself. Whether God exists or
not is secondary. Prayer is primary. And when prayer is primary, it reveals God, it opens your eyes. It
CREATES God. Suddenly the world becomes afire when you are afire. When your heart IS aflame,
suddenly you see the whole world aflame with the divine, with the unknown, with the mysterious.
”If he no longer or does not yet exist, what difference does it make?”
This is beautiful. This is how a really religious person thinks.
”My prayer, that will bring him into being...”
Prayer will become the womb. I will give birth to God through my prayer. This is the Sufi approach.

But before God appears, appears the Master. The Master is a link between you and the God. First
the prayer reveals the Master. That is one step, and half the journey. And the second step and the
journey is complete.
Prayer is naive: it is waiting for someone who never comes... asking for something or someone who
is not there, not at Least now. ”If there be a God who loves man, let him speak. NOW.”
This is what the poet Seneca says in his tragedy THYESTES. The prayerful heart is saying, ”I am
speaking to you, I am provoking you – are you there? Just give me a little hint, a small word, a
gesture, and that will do. Are you there?” And a thousand and one times you shout to the skies
and there is no response. Your prayer disappears into nothingness. But even though the prayer
disappears into nothingness, and there is no response from the other side, from the other shore, still
the prayer goes on changing you.
The effects are very visible. It may not change the reality outside you, but it goes on changing you.
You become softer and softer, more feminine and more feminine, and one day when you have really
melted, when you are no more hard and solid, when you are a flow, the response comes – and NOT
from the other shore but from the innermost core of your being. Really, that is the other shore.

People think disciple hood is nothing to be attained. It needs great discipline to become a disciple.
Both words, ’discipline’ and ’disciple’, mean the same. The original root means the capacity to learn.

Till evening he waited, and then he thought, ”This man is crazy – he may have forgotten.” So he took
the food, went to the mosque – and he saw tears in the eyes of the Master. The SAME kind of tears!
He was puzzled and he said, ”Why are you crying?”
And he said, ”Why shouldn’t I? You have beaten me so much!”
And the disciple said, ”What are you talking about? I, and I can beat you? And you never came and
you had promised!”
And the Master said, ”I came – and not only once. At least twelve times!”
Then the disciple remembered the dog – exactly twelve times the dog had tried to enter.
And the Master said, ”You have to be capable of seeing the formless now. Don’t be too much
attached to the form. Why should I be thought of only in this form, in this body? Why can’t you find
me in other forms?”

___________

This is the Sufi approach for having contact and communion with a Master: become a disciple. Don’t
search for the Master: search for disciple hood. And let me repeat: the Master appears when the
disciple is ready.
