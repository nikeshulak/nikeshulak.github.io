PRAYER IS AN EXPERIENCE OF RESURRECTION, A REBIRTH, the birth of a new vision, a new
dimension, a new way of looking at things, and a new way of being. Prayer is not something that you
do: prayer is something that you become. It is a state of being. It has nothing to do with the words
that you utter in the temples, mosques, churches. It is a silent dialogue with existence. It is to be in
tune with the total with the whole. To fall in harmony with the whole I sprayer .
The experience is so enormous that it is impossible to be exact about it. It is indefinable. All
definitions fall short. Each definition says something about it, but only something. Much remains
unsaid.
And prayer is such a vast experience that it contains contradictions. So one can say: Prayer is
silence – and he is right, absolutely right. And another can say: Prayer is a dialogue – and he is right
too, because prayer is a dialogue in silence. Now, dialogue and silence seem to be contradictory.
In dialogue you speak, in silence you hear. In dialogue you communicate, in silence you are simply
there – there is nothing to say.
What can be said to God? He knows all that you can say in the first place. You can bow down. You
can celebrate. But still your bowing down, your celebration, your festivity, your thankfulness, your gratitude, they are still ways of speaking. You are trying to say something without words, because
words are very small and the heart really wants to say something.
So it IS a dialogue, although silent. It is a communication in a sense, because you are there and the
whole existence becomes your beloved, the whole existence becomes a ’thou’. And yet there is no
’I’ and there is no ’thou’ – both disappear. Both meet and merge into one unity, one organic whole.
Just as the dewdrop disappears in the ocean, you disappear. There is no separation between you
and existence, so how can there be a dialogue?

Prayer is subjectivity. It is not an object that can be analyzed. In fact, you cannot show your prayer
to anybody. And if somebody insists that ”I don’t see any prayer in you,” you cannot prove it either.
It is like love – less like water, more like love. That’s why Jesus says: God is love. Love is also
indefinable.
Always remember one thing: there are things below you and there are things above you. Things
that are below you, you can be exact about them. Things that are above you, you cannot be exact
about them. They are bigger than you. When prayer exists, it is not that prayer exists in you – on
the contrary, YOU EXIST IN PRAYER. Prayer is higher than you. You just vibrate in that enormous
dimension, that plenitude.
But we have been taught, particularly in this century, to be exact about everything. That has
destroyed many beautiful values in life, that constant desire to be exact. And if you cannot be
exact about something, then the mind tries to deny it.

_

Still, a few things can be said about prayer – but they will not be exact, so I cannot fulfill your desire.
The very nature of prayer prohibits it. And to try to do something against its nature is sacrilege.
So the first thing that I can say about prayer is: a feeling of immense gratitude, a thankfulness. You
are here, in this beautiful world, with these trees and rivers, mountains and stars. In this tremendous
beauty you are pulsating, you are alive. This oppor-tunity you have not earned. It is a gift. Prayer is
a thankfulness for this gift of life. Just to breathe is such a joy, just to open your eyes and see the
greenery. Just to listen to the chirping of the birds, or the sound of running water, or the silence of
the night and the velvety darkness. Or the dawn and the sun rising... we have not earned it! It has
been given to us, and we have not even thanked.
Whether there is a God or not is irrelevant – thankfulness is a must. People think that ”If there is
a God, then we will thank him.” I tell you just the opposite: ”If you start thanking, you will find him.”
There is no other way. If you start feeling grateful, you will find him because he happens only in that
dimension of gratitude.
Just as you cannot see from the ears and you cannot hear from the eyes – eyes can only see,
ears can only hear – exactly like that, only gratitude can find God, can feel God. Gratitude is your
sensitivity for God. Prayer is that sensitivity.

Second thing: prayer is a way of living. It is not just something that you do early in the morning like
a ritual. If it is a ritual, it is meaningless. If it is a ritual, it will not make you religious – it will make you
a Hindu, it will make you a Mohammedan, but NOT religious. Prayer has to be something absolutely
informal, of the heart, not a ritual. Not something that you finish some-how in the morning because
you HAVE to do it and you have been taught to do it – it has become a duty. If you don’t do it, you
feel a little guilty; otherwise, doing it, you don’t feel any joy out of it. When you don’t do it, only guilt
arises. To avoid that guilt, you go on doing it. This is not prayer.
Prayer is a way of living. What do I mean? A man of prayer remains in prayer twenty-four hours a
day. He sleeps-in prayer; his sleep is a kind of prayer. He relaxes into sleep as if he is relaxing into
the lap of God. When he is going to sleep, he sleeps in God. When he wakes up, he wakes up in God. He opens his eyes and the first thing that comes to his heart and to his being is gratefulness,
utter gratefulness. He eats God, he drinks God. He walks in God. He breathes in God, he breathes
God. His twenty-four hours are a continuum of prayer. It goes on running like background music.
Whatsoever he is doing, that does not make any difference – the prayer continues.
And I am not saying that you should start repeating ”Ram, Ram, Ram,” or ”Allah, Allah, Allah.” It
is not a question of repetition. If you start repeating, ”Ram and Ram and Ram,” then it will be an
interference in your life. Then you will not be able to drive rightly on the road, because your mind will
be divided. Then you will not be able to do ANY work totally.
So I am not saying to repeat anything. It is not a question of verbal repetition. It is just a feeling,
presence. Just as the mother sleeps in the night and her child is there by the side of her... and it may
be the rainy season, with clouds and thunder in the sky, but she will not be awakened by the clouds
and the thunder. But if the child just becomes a little uneasy, starts crying, she will be awakened
immediately. Thunder was not enough to wake her, but her child.... Even in her sleep a part of her
being re-members the child. That’s how prayer is.
You live in the marketplace, you work, but DEEP down at the very core of your being, you go on bowing to God – prayer continues, gratitude continues. Sometimes it surfaces when you have a silent moment; otherwise, it continues underground.
Prayed is a way of living, not having, but a way of asking. It is not compelling, not wanting to live from power and possession, but imploring to be allowed to be. 

Asking is the opposite of demanding. Asking is risky. It is entrusting yourself to the silence and the uncertainty of existence. Prayer never demands. There is no possibility of any demanding in prayer because we cannot claim anything. But we can ask, just like a small child asks his mother. There is no demand in him; he is helpless, he is dependent. He simply asks. When he is hungry, he cries – that’s what prayer is. It is childlike helplessness. 

We are so small and existence is so infinite... we are only for a few moments here, and existence has been always here and will be always here. We are just small waves in this infinite ocean. We can ask, but we cannot demand. We can ask because we are not strangers to existence, we are not outsiders. We belong to it. We are part of it. Existence has peopled us. It is existence’s desire that we are. We can ask. But in asking, there is no demanding. 

If it is fulfilled we are thankful. If it is NOT fulfilled, still we are thankful. Remember that. That is the beauty of prayer.

If it is fulfilled, we are thankful, obviously. If it is not fulfilled, still we are thankful. 

Why are we thankful even when it is not fulfilled? Because then the man who knows what prayer is, who lives prayer, also knows that sometimes we ask for a thing which is not good for us. Existence knows better. If it is needed it will be fulfilled. If it is not needed it will not be fulfilled.

Trees are less stupid, stars are not
stupid. You go to them, you open your heart – start a dialogue with nature. And the miracle happens
one day, when suddenly you see that the tree has responded – then you will know what prayer is,
then you will understand Oosterhuis who says prayer is a dialogue. Yes, the tree ANSWERS one
day, you just have to wait long enough. You Just have to convince the tree that you are REALLY
talking to her, that’s all. It takes a little time.
And man has been so destructive to the trees that they have become closed. Let the TREE FEEL
that you are not a madman, that you are not violent, aggressive, that you have come with love, great
love, that you want to feel God. And the creator can be felt only in his creation – that is the beginning
of the journey.
So prayer first has to be a dialogue – a dialogue with whom? I say a dialogue with nature. So even
an atheist can go into it. I don’t bring God in yet. First move into dialogue with nature – that is the
ABE of prayer. And then, slowly slowly, start moving into silence with nature. Sit by the side of a
rosebush and move into tremendous silence, no words between you and the rosebush, just silence
pulsating... waves of silence.
Through dialogue you will know God as he is manifest in nature, and through silence you will know
God as he is unmanifest. Through dialogue you will know God as creation, and through silence you
will know God as creator.

When the disciple is ready, the Master appears – and in no other way.
When the disciple has really prepared his heart, has opened himself up, is vulnerable, has dropped
his arm our, the Master immediately appears. The disciple is the question: the Master is the answer.
Prayer is the bridge between the question and the answer between the disciple and the Master,
between the seeker and the sought, between the immediate and the ultimate, between the desire
and the fulfillment.
Prayer is born out of our experience of love, the way we address each other. Have you not felt
sometimes the difference? We use the same words, but the quality changes. When you say ’you’
to somebody to whom you are indifferent, the word is the same, but there is no prayer in it. And
when you say ’you’ to the woman you love or the man you love, the word is the same but the quality
is different. When you say ’you’ to a woman you love, there is prayer, there is love. The word is
pulsating, alive, streaming. When you say ’you’ to somebody in the marketplace, the word is dead.
Prayer has arisen, slowly slowly, out of the experience of love. When a person falls in love with one
person, such great joy arises that, slowly slowly, it became apparent to people who were intelligent
enough, aware enough, that ”If so much joy comes by falling in love with one person, how much joy
will come if I fall in love with the whole!” Love paved the way to prayer.
People pray to each other when they are in love. See the eyes of lovers when they look at each
other. That look is sacred. It may be momentary, it may be lost, but for a moment the flame is there
For a moment, the guest has arrived from the beyond. People pray to each other when they are in
love. The way one man says ’you’ to another, respectfully, intimately, desperately. The way someone
says ’you’ to you – hopefully, expectantly, intensely, his voice seeking or caressing.
It may be that prayer to God grew out of this way that people have of speaking with each other when
they are in love. Yes, that’s how it has slowly slowly dawned into the consciousness of man – that


if we can say ’thou’ to existence with great love, expectant, desperate, seeking, imploring, asking,
with tears in the eyes, with hope, with helplessness; if we can say ’thou’ to existence, that is prayer,
the beginning of prayer. A point comes when ’I’ and ’thou’ also disappear – that is the end of prayer,
the crescendo.

Man has lost many capacities, and one of the MOST important has been the capacity to pray –
because it is only through prayer that we make a bridge between our tiny self and the infinite and
the absolute.
You say: WHAT EXACTLY IS PRAYER?
I cannot define it exactly – I can only indicate. I can hint. A few directions I can give to you. You will
have to know it by your own experience.
They say that man can be divided into three groups: those who make things happen, those who
watch things happen, and those who wonder what happened. Please be of the first category. Move
into prayer – that is the only way to know what it is. Love if you want to know what love is; have
a taste of it. How can you explain to somebody who has never tasted wine what it is and what
happens through it? He has never been drunk. There is no way to explain. All that you can do is to
invite him, let him drink. Let him feel lost. Let him forget the world. Let him disappear in the world of
intoxication... and he will know. That is the only way to know.
Prayer is an intoxication. Prayer makes one drunk with God. But only drunkards know it, what
exactly it is. And even those who know it cannot put it into words. Let it become an experience Let
us not only discuss it – let us go into it. This very moment. If you feel grateful, a great silence will
surround you, a great benediction will start surrounding you. This very moment! right now! you can
be thankful for all that the whole has done for you.


If you are a religious person, you can think of the whole in terms of God; if you are not, there is no
need to use the word ’God’. Forget all about it. Words don’t matter. Call it ’the whole’ Just feel what
it has done to you, how much it has given to you and how much it goes on pouring into you. And
you have never thanked it; you are so ungrateful. And still it goes on pouring! Its sharing, its giving,
is unconditional.
And the moment thankfulness arises in you – this can arise THIS very moment – there is prayer.
Nothing stirs in you, all is still. But suddenly one feels like bowing down to some unknown force, to
some mysterious force. That bowing down is prayer.
