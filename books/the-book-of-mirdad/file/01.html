  <p>CHAPTER 1</p><p><br data-cke-filler="true"></p><p>MIRDAD UNVEILS HIMSELF AND SPEAKS ON VEILS AND SEALS</p><p>&NoBreak;&NoBreak;&NoBreak;&NoBreak;&NoBreak;&NoBreak;&NoBreak;<br>Naronda: Upon that eve the Eight were gathered round the supper board with Mirdad standing to one side and silently awaiting orders.</p><p>One of the ancient rules for Companions was to avoid, so much as possible, the use of the word I in their speech. Companion Shamadam was boasting of his achievements as Senior. He cited many figures showing how much he had added to the wealth and prestige of the Ark. In doing that he made excessive use of the forbidden word. Companion Micayon gently reprimanded him. Whereupon a heated discussion arose as to the purpose of the rule and who had laid it down, whether father Noah or the First Companion, meaning Sam. The heat led to recriminations, and recriminations to a general confusion where much was said and nothing understood.</p><p>Wishing to change confusion into mirth, Shamadam turned to Mirdad and said in evident derision:</p><p>‘Behold, a greater than the patriarch is here. Mirdad, show us the way out of this maze of words.’</p><p>All eyes were turned upon Mirdad. And great were our astonishment and joy when, for the first time in seven years, he opened his mouth and spoke unto us saying,</p><p>MIRDAD: Companions of the Ark! Shamadam’s wish, though uttered in derision, unwittingly foretells Mirdad’s solemn decision. For since the day he came into this Ark Mirdad forechose this very time and place – this very circumstance – in which to break his seals, and cast away his veils, and stand revealed before you and the world.</p><p>With seven seals has Mirdad sealed his lips. With seven veils has Mirdad veiled his face, that he may teach you and the world, when you are ripe for teaching, how to unseal your lips and to unveil your eyes, and thus reveal yourselves to yourselves in fulness of the glory which is yours.</p><p>Your eyes are veiled with far too many veils. Each thing you look upon is but a veil.</p><p>Your lips are sealed with far too many seals. Each word you utter forth is but a seal.</p><p>For things, whatever be their form and kind, are only veils and swaddling-bands wherewith is Life enswaddled and enveiled. How can your eye, which is itself a veil and a swaddling-band, lead you to aught but swaddling-bands and veils?</p><p>And words – are they not things sealed up in letters and in syllables? How can your lip, which is itself a seal, give utterance to aught but seals?</p><p>The eye can veil, but cannot pierce the veils.</p><p>The lip can seal, but cannot break the seals.</p><p>Demand no more of either one of them. That is their portion of the body’s labours; and they perform it well. By drawing veils, and by setting seals they call aloud to you to come and seek what is behind the veils, and to pry out what is beneath the seals.</p><p>To pierce the veils you need an eye other than that shaded with lash, and lid, and brow.</p><p>To break the seals you need a lip other than the familiar piece of flesh below your nose.</p><p>First see the eye itself aright, if you would see the other things aright. Not with the eye, but through it must you look that you may see all things beyond it.</p><p>Speak first the lip and tongue aright if you would speak the other words aright. Not with the lip and tongue, but through them must you speak that you may speak all words beyond them.</p><p>Did you but see and speak aright, you should see nothing but yourselves and utter nothing but yourselves. For in all things and beyond all things, as in all words and beyond all words, are you – the seer and the speaker.</p><p>If, then, your world be such a baffling riddle, it is because you are that baffling riddle. And if your speech be such a woeful maze, it is because you are that woeful maze.</p><p>Let things alone and labour not to change them. For they seem what they seem only because you seem what you seem. They neither see nor speak except you lend them sight and speech. If they be harsh of speech, look only to your tongue. If they be ugly of appearance, search first and last your eye.</p><p>Ask not of things to shed their veils. Unveil yourselves, and things will be unveiled. Nor ask of things to break their seals. Unseal your selves, and all will be unsealed.</p><p>The key to self-unveiling and self-unsealing is a word which you forever hold between your lips. Of words it is the slightest and the greatest. Mirdad has called it THE CREATIVE WORD.</p><p>Naronda: The Master paused; and silence deep, but vibrant with suspense, fell upon all. At last Micayon spoke in passionate impatience.</p><p>Micayon: Our ears are hungry for THE WORD. Our hearts are yearning for the key. Say on, we pray, Mirdad, say on.</p>
