CHAPTER 2

There is no Self, no Other

2 July 1978 am in Buddha Hall

The first question:
Question 1
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MASTER AND A PSYCHOTHERAPIST?
A MASTER IS NOT: A PSYCHOTHERAPIST IS. The Master is a hollow bamboo, a mere passage,
for the divine to descend. He is not on his own. He has nothing to say, he has nothing to do –
but much happens through him. But it is always through him. He is not the doer of it. He is just a
watcher. He allows it, he does not hinder it. He cooperates with it, but he is not the originator of it.
He is just a vehicle.
The psychotherapist IS. He is a doer, knowledgeable. He has all the expertise available. He is not
a hollow bamboo. He is not an absence. Hence much cannot happen through him. He can only do
a patchwork: here and there a little polishing, a little white-wash, a little adjustment – that’s all. His
work is trivial. Man’s work is bound to remain trivial. Only God is great. And only that which comes
from God is vast.
Man’s doing is bound to remain petty, small – of no significance in fact, or only of momentary
importance. But when God descends, something of the eternal reaches into your being.
The psychotherapist knows about the mind and the workings of the mind. But man in his deepest
core is not a mind at all. That’s the problem. Man’s disease, man’s illness, is not only that of mind –
it is spiritual, it is metaphysical, it is existential.

CHAPTER 2. THERE IS NO SELF, NO OTHER

The physiologist, the physician, can help you about the body; and the psychologist, the
psychotherapist, can help you about the mind – but these are just your surfaces. You are not your
surface: you are your depth. Neither the physician can touch that depth, nor the therapist can touch
that depth. That depth can only be touched by a Master – because he IS that depth.
A Master is a no-mind. And that is the greatest difference that is possible. The psychotherapist
knows about the mind, is a very cultivated mind, cultured, educated, efficient. Technologically he
knows the know-how.
The Master is a no-mind. He has no know-how. He makes his nothingness available to the disciple,
but that nothingness IS a healing force. The psychotherapist TRIES to heal, but never succeeds.
The Master never tries to heal, but always succeeds. His love is his therapy. Out of his absence
flows his love.
And that love is God’s love in fact.
When Jesus says again and again, I and my Father are one, this is exactly what he is saying: Don’t
think of me as myself. I only represent. I am just a symbol. I am just a door. LOOK through me and
you will find the beyond.
The Master lives in a totally different reality. The psychotherapist lives in the same reality where you
live. There is no qualitative difference between you and the psychotherapist; between the patient
and the doctor there is no qualitative difference. The difference is that of knowledge, that of quantity.
He knows more than you know, but he is nOT MORE than you are! He is exactly at the same level.
He is worried with the same anxieties. He is troubled by the same nightmares.
Sigmund Freud himself remained obsessed with the fear of death his whole life. How is he going
to help? And he is the founder of psychoanalysis. How is he going to help? All his help can only
be a pretension. He himself is trembling. He was so afraid of death that even to mention the word
’death’ was enough... and he would start perspiring. Just the mention of ghosts was enough... and
he would fall in a swoon. And it was not only so with him.
Carl Gustav Jung was exactly the same. He was so afraid of death that he could not see a dead
body. He always wanted to go to Egypt to see the ancient mummies. He was very much interested
in the occult, and certainly the pyramids of Egypt have great keys of occult knowledge, and those
mummies are carrying some great messages to be deciphered and decoded. He had become aware
of it. He wanted to go, and many times he tried to go but never could he manage. He would fall
ill. Whenever he would arrange to go to Egypt he would fall ill – just the idea of seeing the dead
mummies, three thousand years old, was enough to shake him to the very roots. Slowly slowly, he
became aware that whenever he made the arrangement he fell ill – that illness was psychological.
Once it happened: somehow he dragged himself to the airport; even though he had a fever out of
his fear, he went to the airport – but could not manage to enter into the aeroplane. From the airport
he rushed back home. He became so frightened that he dropped the whole idea for ever, and he
never went to Egypt to see those mummies. And he was very much interested in them.
Now, how are these people going to help?

CHAPTER 2. THERE IS NO SELF, NO OTHER

A Master knows there is no death – not only knows through others but through his own experience.
He has looked deep into his life, and death has disappeared like a fog – evaporated. A Master is
one who is absolutely free, not only from pathological psychology but is free of psychology itself, is
free of mind. He has cut the very root of all pathologies.
With the psychotherapist your relationship is that of a patient and doctor. It is not intimate – it cannot
be. It is professional. With the Master your relationship is that of love; it is not professional. It
is intimate. It is the most intimate relationship there is. Yes, not even between lovers does such
intimacy exist as exists between a Master and a disciple. It is a marriage. And such a marriage
where not only bodies, not only minds, but two beings meet.
The psychotherapist is trying to become the Master in the West. A strange phenomenon is
happening: the psychotherapist is trying to become the Master, is trying to become the guru –
and the priest, the guru, is trying to become the psychotherapist! Now priests talk about psychology,
and psychologists talk about religion – because priests are seeing that whatsoever they have been
selling up to now cannot be sold any more – it is out of date. People are no more interested in it.
People are no more interested in theology. People are interested in knowing about their mind and
its working; people are more interested in having a better mind, more efficient, more calm and quiet
and collected.
So the priest is moving, slowly slowly, from theology to psychology. And the psychoanalyst, the
psychotherapist, is becoming aware of the phenomenon that the people’s real problems are not
psychological but religious.
Carl Gustav Jung is reported to have said: ”observing thousands of patients in my life, this has been
one of my most important conclusions – that people who come to me after the age of forty-two, or
nearabout, are not really suffering from any psychological problems but are suffering from religious
problems.”
I perfectly agree with Jung – that is the time when a person suddenly becomes aware of death. Just
as at the age of fourteen a person suddenly becomes aware of sex, and sex becomes important,
and sexual fantasies come rushing towards his being from all over the place, and each thing starts
taking a sexual color – the dress, the way he walks, the way he talks, the way he looks – everything
starts taking a sexual tinge, just like that, at the age of forty-two suddenly death is encountered for
the first time. Life starts declining. One has to be ready for the second phase of life. And the modern
society does not prepare people for the second phase.
For life you have been prepared in the school, college, university – for almost twenty-five years you
have been prepared! You have been taught how to live, but you have not been taught at all how to
die. And death is the culmination of life. It is a great art.
Religion is the art of death – how to die joyously, how to die with hallelujah on your lips, how to die
dancingly. How to transform the quality of death into the quality of samadhi. How to transform the
experience of death into the experience of communion with the divine.
It is near about the age of forty-two that suddenly religion starts becoming important. And modern
man does not accept that, so a thousand and one problems arise. Jung is right: people suffer

CHAPTER 2. THERE IS NO SELF, NO OTHER

from something which is not psychological but religious. They need an understanding that can help
them to go through death. They need some awareness of the immortality of the soul. They need
something that is not part of the body but is part of the beyond, so they can trust it. They need a
boat so when they leave the body they can move to the other shore.
The psychologists are becoming aware that people’s problems are fundamentally religious, so they
are turning to be gurus. And the priests and the gurus, seeing that their old theologies, their old
gods, are just out of fashion, nobody is interested in those old gods and old scriptures... people may
not say anything out of politeness, but the moment you mention the word ’god’ people feel a little
embarrassed. They start looking sideways. They want to avoid the subject and the topic completely.
They don’t want to hear about the angels and heaven and hell. And certainly they are not interested
in your so-called great theological problems about how many angels can dance on a single pin-point.
These things look stupid now. Man has grown out of all this. These are hangovers.
So a strange phenomenon is happening. But remember, when the priest talks about psychology
he looks stupid, because he is just trying from the back door to bring religion in. ale cannot find
any other proofs, so now he is calling on psychology. And psychology cannot give ANY proofs Torn
religion. So all the proofs that he gathers through psychology are just imaginary, artificial, arbitrary,
somehow managed and manipulated, not valid. He looks stupid.
And so is the case with the psychotherapist who turns to be a guru – because it is not only through
knowledge that you can become a Master: you will have to grow in being. No university can make
you ready for it. You will have to go inside yourself; you will have to travel a long way in your inferiority.
So all that the psychologist or the psychotherapist talks about religion remains just bare, mere
philosophy. His personality gives no evidence of it.
I hove heard:
”There is nothing wrong with you,” said the psychiatrist to his patient. ”You are just as sane as I am.”
But, doctor,” cried the patient, as he brushed wildly at himself, ”it’s these butterflies – they’re all over
me!”
”For heaven’s sake, ”cried the doctor, ”don’t brush them off on me!”
Now that man is mad – there are no butterflies – but to work with mad people, how, long can you
remain sane? It has been the observation of many people that in a madhouse, the maddest person
it the doctor. Working with mad people continuously, slowly slowly, rather than changing them, which
is very difficult, he becomes changed by them.

fancy to you, doctor! How about a kiss?”
”Absolutely not!” the doctor replied indignantly.

”Well, as I was saying,” the patient continued, ”I’m always having arguments with my husband about
his father, and just yesterday... I’m sorry, but it just occurred to me again. What harm would there
be if you gave me just one little kiss?”
”That’s absolutely impossible!” the doctor snapped. ”In fact, I shouldn’t even be lying on this couch
with you!”
The psychotherapist is not much different from you, cannot be. He knows a little bit more than you
know about the mind. But by knowing more about the mind, nothing is helped. One has to go
beyond the mind.
Psychotherapy thinks that there are unhealthy minds AND healthy minds – but the experience of
the Buddhas is totally different. They say: Mind as such is unhealthy. There are no healthy minds.
Mind AND unhealthy are synonymous. So you cannot make the mind healthy. Yes, you can make it
more adjusted, you can make it normally unhealthy, not abnormally unhealthy. You can bring it to a
point where it is just like everybody else. That is normal unhealthy, normal neurosis. But you cannot
make mind healthy. It is impossible. Can you make a disease healthy? If the disease is there, you
are unhealthy. You cannot say, ”Now I have a very healthy disease.”
Mind is the disease! The Master is one who has seen it and gone beyond the mind, who lives in the
land of no-thought, who lives in that absolute silence. But from that absolute silence, the impossible
becomes possible. Just to be with a Master is to be in a healing presence.
The Master is not a therapist, but his presence is therapy. His presence heals, and heals wounds of
so many lives. But his process of healing is not psychological: it is existential. He does not go on
tackling each of your diseases separately: he simply cuts the root in one single stroke. He cuts the
mind. He does not bother about the branches and the leaves.
The psychotherapist goes on cutting the leaves. You have this fear, afraid the psychotherapist will
try years of psychoanalysis and somehow you become adjusted to the fear.
A man continued to piss in his bed in the night. Now he was getting to be thirty-five – it was already
too late. He was married, he had children. Now it was time for the children to piss in the bed – and
he was still doing it.
The wife suggested, ”Why don’t you go to the psychotherapist?”
So he went. Then the LONG psychotherapy continued... analysis is a long process, and very costly.
And after six months a friend asked, ”How are things going?”
He said, ”Perfect!” He was buoyant, flowing with joy. He said, ”Perfect. I have found the greatest
psychotherapist there is in the world.”
The friend asked, ”So he has cured you?”
He said, ”No, but I no longer feel guilty about it. He has convinced me that this is perfectly natural,
normal – in fact, he himself does it.”

The psychotherapist is in the same boat as you are in. All that he can do is a little bit of patchwork.
The Master KILLS you, destroys you, in your totality – gives birth to a new man. The Master becomes
a mother to you, a womb. To be a disciple is to enter into the womb of the Master. It is a death and
a resurrection.

OH OSHO,
IS IT PRAYER
THAT’S THERE?
YES, VANDANA, THIS IS PRAYER. Prayer is not a formality. You need not go to a church to pray –
and those who go, they don’t understand what prayer is. You need not go to a temple or a mosque
or a GURUDWARA – and those who go, they are only pretending.
Prayer is something of the heart. It can happen anywhere. And wherever it happens, there is the
temple. You need not so to the temple to pray, but WHEREVER you pray, you create a temple, an
invisible temple. Wherever somebody bows down in prayer to existence, that place becomes sacred.
To a praying heart, any stone becomes Kaaba, any water becomes Ganges water. To a praying
heart, each tree is a Bodhi Tree. The question is not of formality: it is of the feeling of being,
uplifted. Yes, exactly that’s what prayer is: when you suddenly feel you are being uplifted, when
gravitation has no more pull over you, when you know that all the weight has disappeared, that
you are weightless; when there is no past hanging around your neck like a rock, and when there
is no future distracting you, driving you away from the present – when THIS moment is all, THIS
HERE, THIS MOMENT, is all in all, something opens up in the heart and a fragrance is released.
Sometimes in words, sometimes in silence. Sometimes in meaningful words, and sometimes just

CHAPTER 2. THERE IS NO SELF, NO OTHER

like a child babbling. Sometimes it may become a song, or a dance. Sometimes you may just be
sitting like a Buddha – utterly quiet, unmoving; a center of a cyclone sometimes.
Prayer has no fixed form. And the moment you give it a fixed form, you destroy it. Prayer is
spontaneity. And whenever it comes, it always comes with a new flavor. You cannot predict it.
And whenever it comes, it comes from the blue – you cannot drag it. Yes, you can invite it, but you
cannot produce it on order. When it comes, it comes. It comes like a breeze, and suddenly you are
full of it. And then it is gone. Its coming is beautiful – its going, too, is beautiful. When it comes you
are bathed, basked. When it goes, it leaves a GREAT silence, the primordial silence, behind it. Just
as when a storm goes and all becomes utterly silent.
Its coming is beautiful: its going is beautiful. But never for a single moment think, Vandana, that you
can manage it. If you try to manage it, you will miss its spontaneity. You will kill it. Then it will not
be the bird on the wing in the sky. Then it will be just the bird in your golden cage – looks only like
the bird. Where is that beauty? Because beauty is intrinsically part of freedom. No beauty can exist
without freedom. Wherever freedom is lost, beauty is lost. Slavery is ugly.
Yes, the bird was beautiful on the wing in the sky, whispering with the clouds. There was great
benediction. Weighing its wings high up in the sky, just floating in a kind of let-go. And there was
great joy. Just to WATCH it was an ecstasy. Now you have caught hold of the bird, and you may
have put it in a golden cage studded with diamonds – but what are diamonds to a bird? What is gold
to a bird? Its gold is the open sky, and its diamonds are the free-floating clouds and the sun and the
moon and the stars.
The bird in the cage looks alive but is no more alive. It is just appearance. So is the prayer. If you
manage it, it is a bird in the cage. Never manage prayer. These are great things. Man should be
very very respectful about these great things.
And man has not been respectful! That’s why there is so much prayer going on in the world –
Hindus praying, Mohammedans praying, Christians praying – everybody is praying, and WHERE
IS PRAYER? If so much prayer were really going on, the world would be a paradise. If so much
prayer were coming out of the hearts, there would be duds of prayer gathering all over the earth
and showering. But there seems only to be hatred, violence, war. Prayer is nowhere to be found.
Something is wrong.
This prayer is artificial.
Vandana, whatsoever is happening to you, allow it. Never catch hold of it. The mind tries to catch
hold of it. That’s why I am insisting, so that you remain aware. Whenever something beautiful
happens – mind is a hoarder, mind is very greedy – whenever something beautiful happens it
immediately wants to catch hold of it. It immediately wants to become a master of it, so that it
can reproduce it again and again whenever it wants.
But there are things which are beyond you: love, meditation, prayer, beauty, grace, God. These are
things beyond you! You can at the most OPEN yourself, INVITE them, and wait. But you cannot
drag them in. Dragged, you will have something artificial, plastic. The real will never come to you.
These are things you can have only with open hands.

But the mind says, ”When it is there, don’t lose the moment – catch hold of it. Keep it in your fist, or
put it in your safe-deposit and lock it up.”
You cannot Lock flowers in a safe-deposit. Money you can lock because money is dead. Flowers
you cannot lock because they are alive. They have to be on the trees, rooted in the earth and rooted
in the sun, and rooted in the wind. They exist only in that aliveness all around. Cut from all sources
of life they will die and stink.
Yes, this is prayer:
A GRATEFULNESS FALLS
AND RISES WITH EACH BREATH
AND PEACE FLIES ON BEATING WINGS
TO SETTLE DEEP WITHIN MY SOUL...
OH OSHO,
IS IT PRAYER
THAT’S THERE?
Yes. This is prayer. Now be watchful. Let it come and let it go.... Never hinder its process. When it
comes, feel thankful. When it doesn’t come, wait. Don’t complain – it will come. It will come more
and more. If you can wait, with great longing, AND patience, it is bound to come. It always comes.
The third question:
Question 3
OSHO, SAY SOMETHING MORE ABOUT SELF-KNOWLEDGE. THAT’S MY WHOLE INTEREST
AND INQUIRY.
SELF-KNOWLEDGE IS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS. When it really happens, there is no self
and there is no knowledge. If the self is there, it can’t happen. If knowledge is there, it has not
happened. So a few preliminary things to be understood.
First: for self-knowledge to happen, the self has to go. You have to forget all about your ego. You
have to be in a state of egolessness.
And the second thing: you have to forget all about knowledge too. If you are continuously hankering
to know, that very hankering will prevent you. God reveals himself only to those who are not
hankering for anything, who are not desiring anything – not even to know God. Mysteries are
revealed only to those who simply wait, who make no demand on God. They wait with open eyes,
they wait with open heart, but with no demand.
The Perfect Master, Vol 2

26

Osho

CHAPTER 2. THERE IS NO SELF, NO OTHER

Your demand is basically ego-oriented. Why do you want to know? Because knowledge gives
power.Try to understand it. Knowledge IS power. The more you know, the more powerful you
become. Ego is always interested in becoming knowledgeable. If you know about nature, you
become powerful over nature. If you know about people, you become powerful over people. If you
know about your own mind, you become powerful over your own mind. If YOU KNOW about God,
you will become powerful over God.
The search for knowledge, deep down, is really the search for power. And how can you be powerful
over reality? The very idea is ridiculous. Allow the reality to be powerful over you... relax. And allow
the reality to take possession of you, rather than you trying to take possession of reality.
To be really in a state of self-knowledge, one has to forget self and forget ALL inquiry into knowledge.
Then it happens! and only then it happens.
There have been three efforts in the whole history of human consciousness concerning selfknowledge.
The first effort is of the realist. The realist denies the self; he says there is no self inside, no subject;
only the object exists, the thing, the matter, the world. That is his way to avoid the inner journey.
The inner journey is dangerous. You will have to lose all! Self-knowledge and all, root and all – you
will have to lose all. The realist cannot take that risk. He finds an explanation. He says, ”There is
no soul. There is no self. All that exists in the world is objects.” So he becomes concerned with
knowing the objects. He forgets the subjectivity and becomes occupied with the objectivity. That’s
what science has been doing for three hundred years. It is a way of escaping from oneself.
The second way is that of the idealist who says there is no object: the world is MAYA – illusion.
There is nothing to know outside, so just close your eyes and go in. Only the knower is true – the
known is false. The realist says only the known is true and the knower is false; the idealist says only
the knower is true and the known is false. And just see the absurdity of it – because how can there
be a knower if there is no known? And how can there be a known if there is no knower?
So the idealist and the realist are only choosing half of the reality. About the other half they are afraid.
The realist is afraid to go in, because to go in means to go into emptiness, into utter emptiness. It
is to fall in a bottomless pit, in an abyss... unpredictable. Where one will land nobody knows, or
whether there is any landing at all.
The realist is afraid of the knower, so he denies it. Out of fear he says it is not: ”My whole concern is
with the known, the object.” And the idealist is afraid of the object, of the world, of the enchantments
of the world, of the magic of the world. He is afraid of getting lost into the desires and passions. He
is afraid of getting entangled into things – money, power, prestige. He is SO afraid that he says, ”All
is dream. The world that is outside is not real. The real world is inside.”
But both are being half true. And remember: a half-truth is far worse than a total lie. At least the
total lie has one quality about it: it is total – the quality of totality. And one thing is beautiful about
a total lie: it cannot deceive you long – because it is such a lie, even the stupid person will be able
to see sooner or later that it is a lie. But the half-truth is dangerous – even an intelligent person can
get lost into it.
The Perfect Master, Vol 2

27

Osho

CHAPTER 2. THERE IS NO SELF, NO OTHER

And then there is the third way: the way of the mystic. He accepts both, and rejects both. That is
my way. He accepts both because he says, ”On one plane both exist – the knower and the known,
the subject and the object, the inner and the outer. But on another plane, both disappear and only
one remains – which is neither the known nor the knower.”
The mystic’s approach is total. And I would like you to understand the mystic’s approach as deeply
as possible. On one level both are right. When you are dreaming, the dream IS true, and the
dreamer is true. When you are awake in the morning, it is no more true. Now the dreamer is gone,
the dreaming is gone – both have gone. Now you are awake. Now you are existing on a totally
different level of consciousness.
The world is true, the ego is true, when man is ignorant, unconscious, unaware. When man becomes
aware, when Buddhahood happens, then the world is not there, neither is there any ego – both have
disappeared. ”Both have disappeared” does not mean that nothing is left: both have disappeared
into each other. Only one is left now, two are not left. The knower and the known have become one.
That oneness is what is really meant by self-knowledge. But the word is not right. No word can be
right. About such great experiences which go beyond duality, no word can be right.
Man tries in two ways to overcome the epistemological dichotomy which is inherent in self-knowing.
One way is to confine his knowing to objects of the world of the non-self. This way is to escape from
self-knowledge. The people who want to escape from self-knowledge condemn it as introverted,
unsocial, abnormal, even perverted. They call it a kind of intellectual masturbation, navel gazing:
they call these people lotus-eaters, dreamers, poets, mystics, somehow gone astray from reality.
How much of the pursuit of research in the natural sciences is motivated by the effort to keep our
attention off ourselves? This question has to be asked.
People become interested in scientific research – why? Are they really interested in some scientific
project? or are they simply trying to avoid going in? The greater possibility is that they are avoiding
going in.
Albert Einstein said before he died that if God were going to give him another chance to be born, he
would not like to become a scientist again. A friend who was by the side of the bed asked, ”Then
who would you like to become?t’
And he said, ”Anybody, but not a scientist. I would like to become a plumber even, but not a scientist.”
Why? Albert Einstein was a man of great sensitivity, of great intelligence; a man who could have
easily become a Buddha. Had all the potential, and missed – because he poured ALL his intelligence
into the objective world. He became too much concerned about the stars and time and space,
etcetera, and he forgot completely about himself. He became so much engaged with other things
and other problems that he forgot completely who he was, or that some time has to be given to
oneself too.
One of the socialist leaders of India, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, went to see him. He was telling me
that when he went to see Albert Einstein he had to wait six hours. The time had been fixed by Albert
The Perfect Master, Vol 2

CHAPTER 2. THERE IS NO SELF, NO OTHER

Einstein himself, and again and again the wife would come and bring tea and other things and would
say, ”We are sorry but he is taking his bath.” So long?
Dr. Lohia asked, ”How long is he going to take his bath?”
The wife said, ”Nobody knows, because when he sits in his tub he starts thinking of great things.
And he forgets completely where he is. And we are not allowed to disturb him, because he may be
chasing some subtle train of thought, and if we disturb him it may be a loss to humanity.”
Dr. Lohia became more interested. He said, ”But what does he go on doing sitting there?”
The wife, said, ”Please don’t ask... he plays with soap-bubbles. He keeps himself engaged with
soap-bubbles, and goes on thinking. All the great problems that he has solved, they have been
solved in his tub.”
You must have heard of great scientists becoming absent-minded. Those are not just jokes – there
is a truth in it. They lost track of their own being.
It is said of Immanuel Kant: one night he came back home, he knocked on the door, it was getting
dark, and the servant looked from the window, from the top floor, and said, ”The master is not at
home.”
It is Emmanuel Kant’s house, he is the master, but the servant thought somebody had come to see
the master. So he said, ”The master is not at home. He has gone for a walk.”
And Immanuel Kant said, ”Okay, then I will come later on.”
And he went! After walking for one hour, then he suddenly realized, ”What nonsense has this servant
been playing with me? I am the master!”
If you become too much engaged in outer things, there is a possibility your whole consciousness
will start moving into extroversion. Nothing points to yourself.
Another night, Immanuel Kant came back home. He used to carry a walking-stick. He went in the
room and forgot what is what, so he put the walking-stick on the bed, and he himself stood in the
comer. Only in the middle of the night, suddenly he recognized the fact that something was wrong.
This IS possible. One can become really so much obsessed with the objective... one can lose all
track of oneself. One can fall in a shadow. Scientists live in that kind of shadow. Philosophers live in
that kind of shadow.
Subjectivity is eliminated when objects and objective interests take over. The onto logical imperialism
of scientific methodology is a pressing danger. It is one matter to hold that if something cannot be
known by scientific methods, it cannot be KNOWN, but it is quite another matter to hold that if
something cannot be known by scientific methods it does not EXIST.
And once you become too much obsessed with the objective, then naturally you become obsessed
with the methodology of science too – then that is the only valid method to know. If something is

not available to THAT method, then not only do you say it cannot be known, you start saying, slowly
slowly, unconsciously, unawares, that if it cannot be known through scientific method it cannot exist.
That’s why scientists go. on saying God does not exist. Not that God does not exist – it is just their
methodology. Their methodology is for the object and God is your subjectivity. Their methods are
meant to catch hold of that which is separate from you. And God is not separate from you: God is
your innermost being, your inferiority.
Through scientific methods, love cannot be proved. That does not mean love does not exist. For it,
a different methodology is needed, a different approach, a different vision, a different way of seeing.
The scientist avoids the problem of self-knowing by getting more and more interested in the objective
world. By getting more and more into things, he goes farther and farther away from himself.
And there is a third effort also to overcome the subject/object dichotomy, and that is the way of the
mystic. One way to AVOID this problem of subject and object is that of the scientist: only object
exists. The other way to avoid the dichotomy – because it is insoluble – is that of the idealist: to say
that the world is illusory, it doesn’t exist, it is MAYA, close your eyes. Both are wrong. The third is the
method of the mystic: he TRANSCENDS. He does not deny reality to the object, he does not deny
the reality to the subject – he accepts the reality of both. He bridges them.
That is the meaning of the famous Upanishadic statement: TAT-TVAM-ASI – That art thou. This
is a bridging. In this bridging, self-knowledge happens. Self disappears, knowledge disappears –
knowing remains. A clarity, a transparency. All is clear. There is nobody to whom it is clear, and
there is nothing which is clear – but ALL IS clear. It is only clarity and clarity....
This is called by the Buddhists: The Lotus-Land of Buddha. All is clear and fragrant, and beautiful,
and graceful. Then the splendor opens its doors.
The mystic transcends the problem by attempting a form of knowing in which the knower and the
known are merged into one unit. Now nothing is left in the concept of ’knowledge’. Knowledge
cannot be divided into direct and indirect. All knowledge is indirect. Knowledge is a salute, not
an embrace. It is a representation, a symbolization, a universalization, an analysis. In a sense,
knowledge is a form of falsifying; for reality is concrete, particular, specific, unanalyzed. Knowledge
is a dry and dead fact – it is not wet experience. And experience is not knowledge but knowing.
That’s why Krishnamurti always uses the word ’experiencing’ rather than ’experience’. He is right.
He turns the noun into a verb: he calls it experiencing. Remember that always: transform nouns into
verbs and you will be Dover to reality. Don’t call it knowledge: call it knowing. Don’t call it life: call it
living. Don’t call it love: call it loving. Don’t call it death: call it dying.
If you can understand that the whole life is a verb, not a noun, there will be great understanding
following it like a shadow.
There is no self and there is no other.
The great Jewish mystic and philosopher, Martin Buber, says that prayer is the experience of I and
thou, a dialogical experience a dialogue. Yes, in the beginning prayer is so, but not in the end. For
The Perfect Master, Vol 2

CHAPTER 2. THERE IS NO SELF, NO OTHER

the beginners, prayer is a dialogue between I and thou. But for those who have arrived, prayer
is not a dialogue because there is neither I nor thou – only one. Dialogue cannot exist. It is not
communication: it is communion. It is not even union, but unity.
Self-knowledge is of great importance. Nothing else is of more importance than that. But remember
these two pitfalls: one is denying subjectivity and becoming a realist; another is denying reality and
becoming an idealist. Avoid these two pitfalls. Walk exactly in the middle.
And then you will be surprised – the self has disappeared, the knowledge has disappeared. But then
descends knowing. Great light descends, and a light that not only transforms you but transforms
your whole world.
Buddha is reported to have said: The moment I became enlightened, the whole existence became
enlightened for me. This is true. I am a witness to it. Exactly that’s hove it happens. When you
become enlightened, the WHOLE existence becomes full of light and remains full of light. Even
darkness becomes luminous, even death becomes a new way of living.
The fourth question:
Question 4
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND YOU?
I AM SO SIMPLE – something must be wrong with you. You must be knowledgeable. You must be
carrying great prejudices in you. Otherwise, what I am saying are such simple truths; there is no
way to make them more simple. But you must be waiting to hear something else – then problems
arise.
I say one thing. You were waiting to hear something else. And there is collision, they collide. And,
naturally, if anything collides with you, you cannot accept it. It creates confusion. I am here to clarify
things for you, but if you have ideas, a priori ideas, fixed attitudes, prejudices, conditioning, then my
simple statements will collide with your deep-rooted beliefs – and there will be confusion. You want
to hear something else... if I say it then it is perfectly okay. You say, ”I understand.” That’s what you
mean when you say, ”Yes, I understand.” It means I am agreeing with you, but I have no obligation
to agree with you. How can I agree with you? If I agree with you, how am I going to change you?
All hope is, all promise is, in my disagreeing with you, because that’s the only possibility for you to
grow beyond yourself.
But it happens. You have a certain idea. I say something: either you hear something which I have
not said, or your belief is hurt, wounded, you become restless, and in that restlessness you cannot
hear what is being said. Otherwise I am saying such simple things.
The husband came home drunk again. His wife could not stand it. She screamed at him, ”If you
don’t stop this damnable drinking, I am going to kill myself!”
The hapless husband retorted, ”Promises, that’s all I get, promises.”

It is very difficult to hear what is being said. You hear what you CAN hear.
One parent was listening to her six-year-old at his math lesson: ”Three plus one, the sonuvabitch is
four,” he said. ”Three plus two, the sonuvabitch is five. Three plus three, the sonuvabitch is six.”
The mother’s jaw dropped in astonishment. ”Johnny, where in the world did you ever learn to talk
like that?” she angrily asked.
”Oh, that’s the way they teach us at school,” said Johnny.
Unable to believe it, Johnny’s mother visited the teacher and demanded an explanation. But the
teacher was as horrified as the mother – she had no idea where Johnny had learnt those words.
Then she realized what had happened.
”I get it,” she laughed. ”We teach the children to say: Three plus one, the SUM OF WHICH is four;
three plus two, the SUM OF WHICH is five!”
I may be saying one thing... you may be hearing another. Then it becomes very difficult. I talk from
my vision; you listen from your vision. There is a vast difference. So each word that is said to you is
being translated by you, even though I am speaking the same language that you understand – still
it is being translated.
The marriage counselor was advising the bride-to-be. ”The first thing I must tell you is that if you
want to retain the interest of your husband, you must never completely disrobe in front of him when
retiring. Always keep a little mystery about you.”
About two months later, the husband said to his bride, ”Tell me, Jane, is there any insanity in your
family?”
”Of course not!” she responded hotly. ”Why do you ask such a question?”
”Well,” said he, ”I was merely wondering why, during the last two months since we’re married, when
you go to bed you never take off your hat.”
People understand in their own ways. That may be creating trouble for you. You will have to come
closer to my vision of things. In fact, what I am saying is very simple. It is not difficult at all.
Secondly, you will have to leave your past behind. Come fresh to me, clean slates, so I can write
something that has happened to me. If you come with so many things already written on your slate,
I will still write, but it will become very very confusing for you to understand what has been written.
Everything else that you are carrying in your head becomes entangled with what I say. It never
reaches to you exactly as it is said.
Listen to me, not from the head but from the heart. Listen to me not argumentatively but in a kind of
deep intimacy, love, sympathy. Don’t be here like a spectator – become a participant. Fall en rapport
with me. That is the only way to understand what is being said to you, because what is being said
to you is no ordinary message. It is absolute fire. If you allow, it is going to transform you, it is going

to transmute you. If you allow, you will never be the same again. If you allow, this is going to be your
rebirth.
And the last question:
Question 5
I FEEL HOMESICK – WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
HOW AM I TO KNOW? It may mean something really great, metaphysical. Mystics say they feel
homesick, but then they mean they are longing for the original source, the ultimate home. They are
longing for God. But I don’t know about you. You may be simply feeling homesick!
Listen to these stories:
A traveling salesman went into a hashery. He instructed the waitress, ”Look, I want two eggs, and
I want them fried very hard. I want two pieces of toast burnt to a crisp, and I want a cup of coffee
weak, lukewarm, and practically undrinkable.”
”What!” exclaimed the waitress. ”What kind of an order is that?”
”Never you mind,” insisted the salesman, ”Just bring me what I asked for.”
The waitress went back to the kitchen, told the chef there was a loony guy outside and gave him
the order. The chef prepared everything just as it was ordered. The waitress brought the miserable
breakfast back to the table, and said coolly, ”Anything else, sir?”
”Why, yes,” said the salesman. ”Please sit down next to me and nag me. I’m homesick.”
Or this story:
A battling couple had had the worst spat of their marriage. Enraged and disgusted, the husband
grabbed his coat and stormed out of the house. To cool his ire, the sizzling spouse took the subway
to Grand Central and visited some of the local bars to try to forget his troubles. Before long he was
beginning to feel his oats.
By two a.m., the hapless husband decided that he was soused enough to take anything his wife
could mete out. He left a bar and started walking up Eighth Avenue, looking for the subway station.
As he neared Madison Square Garden, he looked up and there in bright neon lights glared the sign:
”Big Fight Tonight.” He paused, refocused his eyes, and sighed: ”Ah, home at last!”
I don’t know what you mean by your question. You say: I FEEL HOMESICK – WHAT DOES IT
MEAN? YOU must really know. If it is the homesickness for God, I can show you the way. And
every-one remains homesick unless one finds God. We have lost our paradise. We have known
how it is to be, what beauty it is to be – we have lost it. We had known it in the mother’s womb.
The memory persists. The memory is not mental: it is in every cell of your body, every fiber of your

body. It continuously persists. It goes on haunting you, it goes on giving you a sense that something
is missing. Things are as they should not be. It goes on goading you towards something that is
possible.
That goal is God – or call it truth, or Nirvana, or what you like. If you are feeling homesick in this
sense, I can help you. If you are feeling homesick in some other sense, go to Deeksha....
