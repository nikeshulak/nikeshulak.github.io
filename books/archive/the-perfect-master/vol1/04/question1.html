CHAPTER 4

Via Confusiva

24 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall

The first question:
Question 1
OSHO, WHATEVER YOU SAY SEEMS TO BE RIGHT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF WHAT
YOU ARE SAYING AT THAT MOMENT. BUT IT MAY BE CONTRADICTORY. YOU DRAW THE
LISTENERS IN ONE DIRECTION CONFIRMING A PARTICULAR POINT, AND AT THE SAME
TIME YOU GO VIA THE BACK DOOR TO THE OPPOSITE POINT. IT IS A SPIRAL – THE
LISTENER HARDLY REALIZES WHAT MAY BE HAPPENING. IS THIS NOT FOOLING THE
LISTENER – UNLESS HE REALIZES THAT THE REAL ANSWER LIES BEYOND YOUR SPOKEN
WORDS?
GOURISHANKAR BHARATI, ALL statements are of the moment. No statement can contain eternity.
And those who claim that their statements ARE eternal are simply lying. They don’t know what they
are saying.
The moment can contain only the moment. So whatsoever I say at the moment belongs to the
moment. It is a flower of THAT moment. If it is raining, I say it is raining. Later on it may not be
raining. The clouds may disperse. It may become sunny.
Yes, my statement is contradicted by another moment – but it is contradicted only if it was claiming
that it has to be true for ever.

I am not giving you dogmas. A dogma is a statement with the claim that it is true for ever. I give
you only momentary flowers. I am not giving you a system that will remain for ever and for ever true.
That is what has happened in the past, and man has suffered enough because of it.
What Buddha said was HIS response to HIS moment. What Mohammed said was HIS response to
the life that he encountered. It can’t be true for ever. And if it has to be true for ever, then life will
never change, then life will become stagnant. That’s why people who believe in dogmas become
stagnant. Their life is no more a flow, they are not river like. They become frozen. Christians,
Hindus, Mohammedans, Buddhists, they are frozen people. They have lost track of all that goes on
constantly changing .
Except change, nothing is eternal.
If I was creating a dogma here, then I would never contradict myself. You would be happy with that!
because you would have something to cling to. You have not come here to become enlightened,
Gourishankar – you have come here to become knowledgeable. My effort is not to impart knowledge
to you: my effort is to awaken you. I can’t allow you to cling to any statement – hence I contradict.
I am always in a hurry to con-tradict, so you don’t have any time to cling to anything. I want to take
all knowledge away from you. I want you to be left alone, in utter emptiness and its purity, and its
virginity.
That’s why my moment IS FOR the moment. It does not claim anything beyond it. Each statement
that I make is only FBI)r THIS moment. Enjoy it! Just enjoy the rose that has bloomed this mowing
– be full of its fragrance, sing it, dance with it, cele-brate it. You are fortunate you have been able to
see THIS flower. But don’t hope that you can keep it for ever. Unless it is a plastic flower it can’t be
eternal. Only false things can be eternal, artificial things can be eternal.
The reality is changing, it is flux, it is a river. Tomorrow I don’t know what I will say. I don’t remember
what I said yesterday. I am in no way concerned with my past, and not concerned with my future
either. This moment is ALL for me. Nothing else exists beyond it. I am UTTERLY disconnected from
the past... and have no plans for the future. When the tomorrow comes we will see. And what I am
saying to you now is not going to become an obligation for me to go on saying it for ever. I have no
obligation to confirm my past again and again. Yesterday is gone, so are the statements that were
made yesterday.
But I understand YOUR problem. Your problem is: Then in what to believe? How to believe? But
who is telling you to believe in anything? Rejoice! Don’t believe. Can’t you see the difference? The
emphasis is different. I am not telling you to believe in anything.
Of course, if I am telling you to believe in something, then I have to persist again and again with the
same thing; I have to say it again and again. That will be a kind of hypnosis. When something is
repeated constantly, you become hypnotized by it. I am not here to hypnotize you. I am here for just
the opposite thing: to dehypnotize you – not only of the statements that I have made in the past but
of the statements of all the enlightened people that have ever existed.
I have to destroy your knowledge, your belief. I have to destroy anything that you can cling to. Only
nothing has to be left there....


One sannyasin has done well. He has called my path VIA CONFUSIVA – that’s right. That’s perfectly
right. It is neither VIA NEGATIVA nor VIA POSITIVE – it is VIA CONFUSIVA.
If you can be so much confused that you drop ALL belief, out of that confusion will come clarity.
When do you feel confused? When exactly? Whenever one of your beliefs is attacked – you become
suspicious: Now what to believe in? Whenever a doubt arises... but how is a doubt possible if there
is no belief?
The man of no-belief cannot doubt either. There is nothing to doubt. 13y destroying your belief I
am destroying the very pos-sibility of doubt. Can you see the point? Doubt is a shadow of belief. It
looks like the opposite – it is not. Only believers can doubt. If you believe in God, doubt can arise.
But if you don’t believe in God, from where can doubt arise? how can doubt arise? A man without
any kind of belief will be without any kind of doubt too. That is clarity.
When I say something and it goes against your belief, doubt arises: Now what to choose? You have
put so much at stake with your belief, you have lived with it for so long, and now suddenly doubt
arises! It shakes you up. It makes you frightened.
And if I go on saying contradictory things every day, great courage is needed to listen to me,
Gourishanker, a great heart to contain, great love to understand me, and an intense desire to know,
a passionate desire to know: ”Whatsoever the cost, I am going to know. If all beliefs are to be
destroyed and all systems have to be dropped and all religions to be thrown into the fire, I am ready.
But I am going to know.”
When this passionate desire is there, you will meet with me. Then you will understand my
contradictions. It is a device. It is creating a situation. I will not allow my people any possibility
to believe in anything, not even in me. When ALL belief has gone, what is left? You are just like
a mirror reflecting all the moods of life, reflecting all the climates. Summer comes and you are
summer... and winter comes and you are winter... and day comes and you are day... and the night
comes and you are night.
This I call totality. And to live in totality is to live in God.
All that I am saying is not a kind of doctrinizing – it is not at all. Its purpose us totally different. But the
purpose is SO different, that’s why such questions arise. When you go to listen to somebody else,
he is there to propound a philosophy; he is explaining his philosophy to you. I am not explaining
because I have no philosophy. I am utterly anti-philosophic.
When you go to a priest he is there to explain to you a certain dogma that he believes in; he is there
to convert you. I am not here to convert you: I am here just to destroy you.
So remember: all statements are of the moment, just as all flowers are of the moment. Spring
comes... and there are so many flowers. And then the spring is gone, and you never go to nature
and say, ”You look very contradictory. Where are the flowers? And how can you go on contradicting
yourself in this way?”
Tao is contradictory. It has to be. That is the dialectics of life. But you never go to nature! If a cuckoo
is calling and then suddenly it stops for no reason at all, you don’t go to the cuckoo and say ”Why


have you stopped? This is so contradictory! Calling so beautifully, and then falling into silence?
Either be silent or go on calling – be consistent!” But you don’t say that.
In the rains the trees are green. In the summer the leaves will disappear and branches will be
standing bare, naked, dry, against the sky. But you don’t go to the trees saying ”How dare you be so
contradictory!”
I am part of this Tao. I am not a philosopher. So all my statements are of the moment, for the
moment. Remember it. There is no need to believe in them. Enjoy them! Relish them! While the
flower is there, drink its beauty. It will be gone soon. Before it is gone, celebrate its being.
Celebrate me! Rather than believing in me, celebrate me. That is the difference – the difference of
emphasis. Let my presence be a feast to you. It should not become a prison. It should not become
a definition of your mind. It should not fill you with ideas but with dance and song.
If you want to remember me, never remember me as a philosopher, as a priest – no, never. Those
are dirty words for me. Remember me as a poet. You never go to the poet and say to him, ”You are
contradictory,” because you understand. A poet has no obligation to be consistent. He can sing a
thousand songs of different moods. When he is sad, he sings a sad song; and when he is happy, he
sings a happy song. You don’t go to him....
My being is more that of a poet. And if you really want to feel my presence, you will also have to
learn the way of poetry. Art to me is the greatest religion – the religion of the future. A esthetics to
me is prayer.
And second: there is no opposite for me. It looks contradictory to you; for me it is not. For me there
are no contradictions at all, because each contradiction is nothing but a complement. There is no
way to really contradict. The night does not contradict the day. It only gives rest to the day energy to
be revived again in the mowing. If there was no night, there would be no day again. It is through the
night that the day lives, regains vitality. And it is through the day that the night is born. It is through
life that death arrives, and it is through death that life comes back again and again. They are not
enemies: they are friends, partners in the same game, complement Aries.
So if you understand me with great love, you will see that those contradictions look like contradictions
to you because your understanding is small. When your understanding is a little greater, when
you have moved to a little higher stage of consciousness, those contradictions won’t look like
contradictions – they will be complement Aries . They will make whatsoever I am saying very rich. It
makes them rich.
If you talk only of Zen, it has a kind of richness. If you talk only about Sufis, it has another kind of
richness. But when you talk about both Sufis arid Zen, your richness is immense. It is more than
the sum total of Zen and Sufism. It is not only Zen plus Sufism: it is Zen multiplied by Sufism – it is
multi-dimensional.
Hence I go on speaking through different windows. Some-times I stand at the window that opens to
the east and I talk about the east and the sun that rises and the morning. And sometimes I stand at
the window that opens to the west and I talk about the evening and the sunset and the beauty of it.
And I go on changing because there are many many doors to the divine.


Jesus says: There are many mansions in my God’s palace. There are millions of possibilities. That
is the infinity of God, that you cannot exhaust him. But to take note of ALL possibilities certainly
makes you infinitely richer.
So there are no opposites for me, but only complementaries.
AND THIRD: there is no answer, real or unreal. I am not giving you any answer as such. What I am
giving you is an insight into the mystery of life, not an answer but an insight into the mystery of life.
If my answer provokes the mysterious in you, I have succeeded. If my answer becomes an answer
to you, I have failed.
Don’t take my answers as answers. I am not a schoolteacher. I have no answers to give you. That
which I have to give you is the sense for the mysterious and the miraculous.
But I understand. It is difficult – I speak one language, you speak another language. When I say
’language’ I don’t mean English, German or French. I mean... my language comes from my being,
your language comes from your being. We may be speaking the same language on the surface, but
deep down it is almost untranslatable, what I am saying to you. It is impossible to translate it into
your language. Then why am I saying it at all?
I am just crazy. I cannot resist. It is overflowing. There is no way to prevent it. I have to say it – just
like a cloud is burdened with rainwater and it has to rain! Whether you are able to soak it in or not,
that is not the point. Rocks may not be able to soak it in. Or, some soil may be able to soak it in and
will be full of greenery and beauty will arise. But that is all undecided. It is an open thing. It may
happen, it may not happen. It depends how you let me in.
I have heard a beautiful story:
A few years ago in France, an extraordinary meeting took place. Some leading philosophers from
England and America had been invited to meet with their continental counterparts. They were to
exchange ideas, share experiences, and discover the extent of possible ’communication’ among
them. In a very congenial atmosphere, meetings were held, discussions took place, and speeches
were made. Many friendships must have been established and no little quantity of wine consumed,
but apparently no philosophic communication took place.
For instance, Gabriel Marcel was trying to explain his ideas about God, grace and transcendence.
He continually met resistance from the audience, from other philosophers: ”But what do you mean
by that? But surely you don’t mean this? How is it possible that...? Isn’t it true that...? etc, etc.... ”
After a while Marcel became exasperated, and the audience as a whole restless. Finally, someone
in the audience asked Marcel why he did not simply say what he meant. Since he had been trying
to do just this for some time, he merely replied, ”Perhaps I can’t explain this to you, but if I had a
piano here I could play it.”
And because there was no piano, no communication was possible.
But I am suspicious: even with a piano it may not have happened – because the other may not
understand the language of music either.


Yes, exactly that’s what is happening here. What I am trying to say to you is a kind of music that I
have heard. It has not been heard verbally. It is in the sound of the running water. It is in the wind
passing through the pine trees. It is in the songs of the birds. It is in the silence of darkness. It is in
the dancing rays of the sun. It is all over the place! But it is a music. And unless you are capable of
understanding this music, you will not be able to understand me. You will go on misunderstanding
me.
You say: IS THIS NOT FOOLING THE LISTENER?
You must have come here to gather some belief – and then certainly you will feel fooled, because
you cannot gather any belief. On the contrary, whatsoever you had will start slipping out of your
hands. If you have come to gather a little more knowledge, you will feel cheated. When you go,
you will riot have more, you will have less. In spite of yourself you will have less. You will have lost
something here. We rob people of their knowledge.
So you may feel that there is some kind of be fooling going on. When I say something, it looks so
clearly, so absolutely right – and the next moment I contradict it. Then whatsoever I say to contra-dict
it looks again right. But again I will contradict it!
Just think of the people, Gourishankar – you are here only for a few days – just think of the people
who have been listening to me year in, year out. They have almost stopped listening, but a new kind
of communication, a communion rather, has started. They are no more worried about my words.
That is no more a concern. They have lost that enthusiasm for words. I have destroyed it.
I have contradicted myself so much that now they are aware of it – there is no need to cling, tomorrow
I will take it away. So what is the point? Wait for tomorrow. Slowly slowly, they have learnt the
beauty of non-clinging. Slowly slowly, they have learnt how not to let my words interfere, and a direct
communication, a communion... their energies start flowing with me. They can flow only when the
word is no more important. Then something far superior takes place.
That’s why I have been speaking so much. It is not to communicate with you through words: it is to
destroy the meaning of the word itself. You will be surprised. The reason why I speak so much is
that I want to destroy all meaning in the word. Listening to me, slowly slowly it disappears. And with
the disappearance of the meaning of the word an existential connection arises. That is real initiation
– when you start hearing my music, when you become attuned to my presence, when you breathe
with me. It happens... it has happened to somebody.
Vasumati has written this:
TODAY AND FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS IN DISCOURSE, AS SOON AS YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK,
MY BODY LIES DOWN ON THE FLOOR. AND SOMETHING STARTS TO HAPPEN. YOUR VOICE
CARESSES ME, UNWINDS MY MUSCLES STRAND BY STRAND, GENTLY LULLS ME AND
PULLS ME INTO YOUR SILENCE UNTIL I AM LIKE A PIECE OF SEAWEED IN THE WAVES
OF YOUR INFINITE OCEAN. OH, OSHO, MY HEART DIES WITH YOU, RISES AND FALLS WITH
YOU, BREATHES WITH YOU. CAN IT BE THAT I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU, GONE WITH YOU, WITH
YOUR VIBRANT, WARM AND SCENTED PRESENCE? WHEN I AM NEAR YOU, ALL QUESTIONS
SIMPLY DISSOLVE AND THERE IS NOTHING BUT MY HEARTBEAT, THE RAIN AND YOUR
VOICE.


Yes, Vasumati, this is it. When words start disappearing, something far deeper, profounder takes
place. Communion. The meeting of the Master and the disciple, not as two minds but as two
presences, merging into each other, melting into each other, losing into each other.
Soon that moment happens when the disciple is no more separate, the Master is no more separate.
They have become one. That unity is the goal of all disciple hood. When that unity has happened,
you have known the Master, you have drunk out of him, you have absorbed him. You have come
home.
