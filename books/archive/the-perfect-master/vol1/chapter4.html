The third question:
BELOVED OSHO,
Question 3
NO OASIS, NO DESERTS,
NO MOUNTAINS, NO VALLEYS,
NO SUMMER, NO WINTER,
NO RAIN, NO SNOW,
NO YES AND NO!
NO SUFI, NO ZEN,


NO TANTRA, NO MANTRA,
NO CROWN, NO CROSS,
NO GAIN, NO LOSS!
ALL IN YOU.
INFINITELY, ETERNALLY
YES AND NO! FOR EVER WITH
YOU!
SEETA, THIS IS THE WAY TO UNDERSTAND ME. I am neither Sufi nor Zen. I am neither male nor
female. I am neither positive nor negative. And I am here to help you to transcend ALL polarities.
Hence I speak on the polarities, so that you can understand them, so that you can become aware
of them – so much so that you are not trapped by them.
I talk to you about Sufism and about Zen so that one day you can go beyond both. You have to
go beyond all standpoints! You have to go beyond all kinds of principles, dogmas, paths, methods,
techniques. To be with me is on the way towards transcendence. I am neither a theist nor an atheist,
neither a Hindu nor a Mohammedan.
I am simply an awareness – full of love. You can also become that, because whatsoever I have
become you can become, because wherever you are I was also there one day, with the same
agony, the same suffering, with the same dichotomies – with the same problems! I was just like you.
That’s why I say you can also be just like me.
To be with a Master is to be with a man who has been JUST like you, because only that man can
help you who has been just like you. If a Master descends from God, he cannot be of much help –
because he has never been a man. If God himself comes on the earth and moves amongst you, he
will be of no help at all. That’s why he has never tried. Or maybe he has tried and failed, so he has
dropped the whole project.
God cannot commune with you. He has never been a man. He will not know where you are. He
will not know how you are suffering. He will not have any compassion for you. He will have no
understanding. And he has always been there where you would like to be. The distance will be vast.
Even if God confronts you, there will be such a gap between you and God that it will be unbridgeable.
Hence the meaning of a Master.
A Master is one who has bell just like you, w ho has arisen out of you, who has moved out of you
and gone ahead. He knows all the pains of the journey. He knows the whole past of man. He
understands – that’s why he has compassion. And he can help, because he is still in the body. His
one hand is still in the world, his other hand has roached God. He can become a bridge. A Master
is a bridge.



Sect a, this is the way to understand me. Don’t let it remain just in the mind. Let it become vibrant in
each cell and fibre of your body. Let it become your heartbeat and your breathing.
The fourth question:
Question 4
WHY DO THE MYSTICS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OF THEIR OWN?
THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU, TO SHARE WITH YOU, but that something has never
even been dreamt by you. They have to wise your language, but in such a way, with such nuances,
twists and turns, that thy can give you an idea of something which is not contained by your language.
That’s why mystics use language in a certain way, and different mystics decide in different ways.
Sufis have decided for parables; their message is all in their stories. Stories have a beauty. Even
children can unduestand them. They can go to the lowest, who cannot understand anything higher,
and even he can understand the story. He will understand according to his capacity, but if you go
on meditating over the story... and one has to meditate over these stories. These are not stories
that you read once and throw them away. They have great meanings hidden in them. You have to
dig again and again. You have to meditate. Slowly slowly, new meanings arrive. As you grow in
sympathy, in trust, in consciousness, in meditation, the meaning grows.
Sufis speak in parables. They have chosen that way because there are so many people in the
world and at different stages of life, at different stations. Something has to be told which can be
understood by all. Now, the parable has a beauty: it can be understood by all in different ways. It is
very unlimited. Those who can’t understand, even they can enjoy it. If today they enjoy it, tomorrow
they may understand it.
Mahavir has chosen a different method. He does not speak at all. Language has been dropped.
Silence is his language. He simply sits with his disciples. Now this will be difficult; not all will be able
to understand it – only the highest. It is said about Mahavir: his first sermon, of course in silence,
was understood only by gods. That’s a way of saying that nobody understood it. It took years for
men, a few men, to understand him.
Jainism is the smallest religion as far as the number of the followers is concerned. Why? The reason
is here: Mahavir didn’t choose a method that can be understood by many people in many ways. He
was a very very mathematical person – that is the reason behind it. He would like to be exact. He
cannot use a parable. A parable is basically inexact. A parable has to be vague. So many meanings
can be in it; no meaning in particular, and many mean-ings in it. It has to be a magic bag: you can
bring out of it any meaning that you want. It will be understood by many people. Millions will be able
to understand, even children will be able to read it. And something will happen to them.
Mahavir was very mathematical. Because he was very mathematical he would remain silent –
because he knew that if he said something it would not be as exact as it is in him, so it was better
not to speak. Silence is his language. Only a few very evolved souls could understand him.
Zen has a different method of its own. It does not use parables. It does not remain silent either. It
uses khans, puzzles, riddles, which cannot be solved by the human mind. That is its way to destroy
the human mind. It takes years.


Never be befooled when you read in books about Zen that the Master hits a disciple and he becomes
enlightened immediately – you don’t know the whole story. He was meditating for twenty-six years.
That part is not told in it. After twenty-six years he has earned the blow of the Master; it is not for
everybody. Don’t think that when you go to a Zen Master he will hit you on your head and you will
become enlightened. He will not hit you at all. He will be very polite with you. He will say, ”Sir, so
great of you to have come to me! I rejoice in your presence.” Don’t think that he will hit you. It has
to be earned. It takes YEARS to get that blow of the Master. That blow can be given only at the last
moment.
When between you and reality there is only a very very thin layer left, so just one blow and the layer
is broken and the bird is out of the egg.... But the bird has to be given a chance to mature in the egg
first. Don’t go breaking eggs before they are ripe, otherwise you will kill the bird. You will not be of
any help.
Zen has its own methodology, very crazy, but of immense power.
YOU ASK ME: WHY DO THE MYSTICS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OF THEIR OWN?
They have to. Each mystic has to create a language according to his understanding, capacity,
according to his past, his experiences. When Jesus speaks he speaks as a son of a carpenter.
Whey Buddha speaks he speaks like an emperor. That is their past. When you speak you have to
use your past.
Buddha cannot speak the same way as Jesus. His terminology is bound to be different. He has
never been to the forest, he has never chopped wood, he has never cut wood, he has never carried
logs to the father’s workshop. He does not know how the freshly cut wood smells. He cannot speak
that language. He cannot use the parable of the shepherd and the sheep, the lost sheep. No, he
has no understanding of the shepherd and the sheep. Jesus can use that parable.
Buddha speaks like a king – the language of the court, the language of philosophy, not the language
of the common person. He has not been a common person – how can he speak that language?
So EACH mystic has to use his own language. And remember: speaking is precarious. People talk
around the subject, interrupt, change the subject, do not understand, are silent. Words heal and
wound, build up and sow confusion. To use the word is to use a very very dangerous weapon. It can
be used for surgery; it can also be used to cut somebody’s throat. And one has to be very skillful.
Many mystics have decided not to speak at all. And those who have spoken, they have also spoken
continuously against speaking. And even if they were very very intelligent, very experienced with
language, very articulate, then too....
The statements of the Buddha seem hard and impossible to us who are full of ideas and
understanding nothing. ”That art thou” – a statement like a sea. You cannot walk on it, you cannot
build on it. It runs like water through your fingers. ”If you meet the Buddha on the way, kill him” – a
statement like a mountain. You cannot see through it, you don’t know what lies behind it. You have
no idea what it means, what it is all about.
Just a few days before, I received a letter from America. Some-body must have read in one of my
books somewhere: ”If you meet the Buddha on the way, kill him.” Now he was very angry. Must be


a very poor Buddhist. He was so angry and annoyed that he wrote to me in great rage: ”Who are
you to tell us to kill the Buddha? How can you say such a sacrilegious thing? To kill the Buddha?
Buddha has to be worshipped, not killed. Buddha is the greatest man who has walked on the earth.
What do you mean by saying ’Kill the Buddha if you meet him on the way’?”
He was really angry. I can understand his anger. He does not understand Buddha, he does not
understand these great statements. And it is not my statement either. Zen people have been saying
it down the ages; it is more than two thousand years old at least. But he may not be aware of it. He
must be thinking that I am somebody who is against Buddha. But Buddha is dead! If I am against
him, how can I say kill him?
These statements ARE like mountains, great mountains. They are like Everest, very difficult to climb
too – every possibility of never reaching to the understanding of them.
He could not understand, this American could not understand, because he must have been brought
up in a Christian way, and then he may have become interested in Buddha. That is the prob-lem.
No Christian can say that: ”If you meet Jesus on the way, kill him.” That is not their language. They
will think this is sacrilegious – that’s what he writes in the letter: ”This is sacrilegious! You must be
an atheist, an irreligious person. You must be a Satan to say such a thing as ’Kill the Buddha.”’ His
upbringing must be Christian; that is ANOTHER kind of language. He does not know the Zen way
of saying things.
It is not said against Buddha – it contains Buddha’s whole message! Buddha will absolutely agree
with it. That’s what he did when he was leaving the world. His last statement was exactly this. He
said to his disciple, Ananda, who was weeping and crying, ”Don’t weep and cry for me! In fact I have
been the barrier to you. Now the barrier is dying, you are free, and it may become more easy for
you to be enlightened. Be a light unto yourself.”
And Ananda had lived with Buddha for forty years, and lived unenlightened. And after Buddha was
gone, within twenty-four hours, he became enlightened. What happened? He was clinging to the
idea of Buddha. That very clinging was a barrier.
It happened in Ramakrishna’s case too:
He was a worship per of Kali – the Mother goddess. And then he came across a very very strange
man, Totapuri. A man like Totapuri very rarely happens in the world. He was like Bodhidharma.
A VERY strange man. Naked he used to walk, utterly free from all kinds of morality, ethics, rules,
regulations. He was a PARAMAHANSA, a JEEVAN MUKTA – he was free in his life, absolutely
free. Freedom was his quality. Just wandering around the Ganges, he came to Dakshineshwar.
Ramakrishna saw him, became interested in him. He had never seen such a freedom, and such
grace and such beauty. And he asked him, ”Help me.”
He looked at Ramakrishna and he said, ”Yes, I will help you. But the only thing is: you will have to
destroy this Mother goddess.”
Ramakrishna started shaking and trembling and perspiring. He said, ”What are you saying? How
can I destroy the Mother goddess? She is my Mother! She has helped me up to now. She is my all
in all. She is my soul, my very heart. I will die!”


Totapuri said, ”So better die, but kill this Mother. If you really want to have freedom, you have to
destroy all connections and all attachments. And this is your attachment. You are not attached to
your wife, so that is not a problem. You are not attached to money, so that is not the problem. You
are not attached to the world, so that is not the problem. Your whole attachment is with this Mother,
this idea of a Mother goddess. And I know, it is beautiful, but still it will keep you away from the truth.”
Ramakrishna would sit in meditation in front of Totapuri, but the moment he would close his eyes,
the Mother goddess was there with all her glory. And he would start swaying, and tears would come
in his eyes. And he would forget all about Totapuri end his freedom. And Totapuri would shake him
up and he would say, ”You have again fallen into the dream. It is ALL dream! Why don’t you take a
sword and cut her in two pieces? Destroy her!”
It happened many times and Ramakrishna was not able... What to say about cutting? – he would
forget all about Totapuri and the idea that he had given him. And he would look at the face of the
Mother inside, and it was so alive and so beautiful, so full of light. It was no ordinary experience: it
was the greatest vision, the ultimate vision of form, God as form, beyond which is only the formless.
Totapuri got fed up and he said, ”Now, today I leave. Before I leave, you try once more, and I have
brought this piece of glass.”
Ramakrishna said, ”For what?”
He said, ”When I see that your tears start coming and you start swaying and you are feeling
orgasmic, I will cut on your third eye with this glass. Blood will start coming. And I will cut DEEP, just
to remind you that I am here!Just to remind you: take the sword and cut the Mother in two pieces.”
And Ramakrishna said, ”From where to bring the sword?”
And Totapuri said, ”From where have you brought this Mother? From the same source – it is all
imagination.”
And that day Ramakrishna tried. Totapuri cut his third eye with that piece of glass. Blood started
Flowing, and he pushed the glass deep into the third eye. In a single moment of awareness,
Ramakrishna took a sword, cut the Mother in two pieces. The Mother disappeared, and it opened
the door for the formless.
For six days he was in samadhi. And when he came back, the first words that he uttered were, ”The
last barrier has fallen. I am infinitely grateful to you, Master Totapuri – infinitely grateful to you. The
last barrier has fallen.”
This is the meaning when Zen people say, or I say to you, ”If you meet the Buddha on the way, kill
him.” In fact I should say to you, ”If you meet me on the way, kill ME” – because you may not meet
Buddha, you may meet me. ’On the way’ means when you start moving from form to no-form, your
Master will be the last barrier. You have become so attached to the Master. You have been in such
love with the Master. You have enjoyed so many delights and ecstasies through him. It seems sheer
ungratefulness to cut him – no, it is not. But this is a Zen way of saying a thing.



Christians will feel offended, Jains will feel offended, Hindus will feel offended, Mohammedans will
feel offended – this is not the right way to talk about your Master!
Different mystics have chosen different ways of speaking, but if you look deep down the message
is not very different. Containers are different but the content is not different. And everybody has to
choose his way of speaking, and has to choose the way that his disciples will understand.
A psychology professor conducted an experiment to prove a point about work. He hired a man to hit
a log with the reverse side of an axe. The man was told that he would be paid twice the amount he
normally made. The fellow lasted half a day. He gave it up, explaining, ”I have to see the chips fly.”
Now, a man who cuts wood, if he is told to cut the wood with the reverse side of the axe, soon
will lose his enthusiasm. He needs to see the chips fly – they keep his enthusiasm, they keep him
moving, they keep his energy flowing. That is his language! He can work only in that language. That
is his noe-sphere – without that he cannot function.
And each mystic has to speak according to himself and according to the disciples that gather around
him. And each mystic attracts a certain kind of people. Can’t you see it: here, a certain kind of
people has gathered – the people of the future. You will not find orthodox people here, you cannot
find. Impossible. You will not find the puritans here, the moralists. You will not find the hypocrites
here. This is not the place for them! I am not the man for them.
One French orientalist went to see George Gurdjieff. Just once he went to see him. The orientalist
used to live in Paris; Guenon was his name. And just close by, a few miles away from Paris, was
Gurdjieff. But only once he went, for half an hour. And then he came back and he started talking
against Gurdjieff – he talked his whole life against Gurdjieff. He used to say to people: ”Flee from
Gurdjieff as you flee from the plague – just flee from him! He is the most dangerous kind of disease
on the earth.” What happened? He was a moralist, very very puritan. And what he saw there in half
an hour’s time was very very different.
Gurdjieff used to force people who were not drinkers, he would force them to drink as much as
possible. Now, that was his device. When a man is utterly drunk, he becomes very very real and
honest. This is a very bad state of affairs, but this is how it is. People have become so false that to
see their original face you have to wait... only when they are absolutely drunk. Then their masks slip
by; they cannot hold them, they are so drunk. Everything becomes shaky and they start coming up
in their true colors.
So each disciple had to go through that torture. It was torture for somebody who had not been
drinking too much or who was against alcohol. Just think of Morarji Desai: if he had gone to
Gurdjieff...! He would force people to drink so much that they would fall on the ground, start uttering
nonsense, shouting, shrieking, abusing. And that was his way of watching them: then he would sit
silently and watch, listen to them. Once he had understood your reality, then there was no problem –
then the work started. But you reveal your reality only when you are drunk. Otherwise, you maintain
your false face.
This moralist saw this happening, and he was aghast. He could not understand it. Sometimes
orthodox people come here, but they escape; they never come back again. It is a different kind of


commune. I can be understood only by the new man that is going to be born, that is on the way. The
past cannot understand me. So I have to use the language of the future.
And you know, everybody has to use his own language.
I have heard:
If a lawyer wishes to give someone an orange, he might say, ”I give you all and singular my estate
and interest, right title and claim, and advantage of and in this orange, with all its rind, skin, juice,
pulp and pips, and all right and advantages therein with full power to bite, cut, suck or otherwise
eat the same orange, or give the same away, with or without its rind, skin, juice, pulp, pips, anything
therefore or hereinafter or in any deed or deeds, instruments of what kind or nature whatsoever, to
the contrary in anywise notwithstanding.”
Now just one orange he is giving to somebody! But this is the way a lawyer speaks, the way of the
law.
Two tramps are sitting underneath a tree. First tramp, lying on a park bench underneath the tree, ”I
just dreamt I had a job.”
Second tramp, ”Yes, you look tired.”
There are languages and languages. The mystics also happen in all kinds of shapes and sizes.
And, of course, they have to use the language that they know, and the language that they would
like to be understood by the people. And the language that they use has to be expressive of their
experience.
Kabir speaks in one way, Krishna in another, Nanak in still another – they were people of different
centuries, different atmospheres, different climates, AND they were talking to different kinds of
people and different potentialities.
The fifth question:
Question 5
WHY AM I SO NICE TO OTHERS AND SO HARD WITH MYSELF?
LET ME TELL YOU ONE STORY:
”Preacher,” complained an aggravated young waggoner, ”I am at my wits’ end about my horses.
They don’t eat anything but hamburgers and french fries. Already they’re so skinny I’m afraid they
won’t last much longer.”
”Let me ask you something,” said the preacher. ”Do you pray every day?”
”Why, er-uh-not usually,” the driver stammered.
”Do you always wash your hands before every meal?”


”Not always.”
”And do you ask God’s blessings before you eat?”
”No!” the driver answered tersely.
”Then all is perfectly clear,” said the preacher. ”It is irrevocably intertwined with the divine law of
compensation. Since you eat like a horse, your horses eat like humans.”
You ask, Deva Sharan: WHY AM I SO NICE TO OTHERS AND SO HARD WITH MYSELF?
It is the law of compensation. If you are so nice with others, you will be hard with yourself. You really
want to be hard with others, but you are hiding it, you are repressing it. It becomes accumulated in
you. And you can’t be hard with others; you have been taught not to be hard with others. So finally,
where are you going to pour your garbage? Only you are left.
It almost always happens: people who are nice to others are hard on themselves – they have to
be. There are ordinarily only two types of people: the murderers and the suicides. Murderers are
people who are dangerous to others, very dangerous – they can kill. And the people who are not
dangerous to others tend to be dangerous to themselves – they can commit suicide.
There is no necessity to be divided in two categories, you can go beyond them. And that’s my
teaching. There is no need to decide A PRIORI that you have to be hard with others or you have to
be nice with others. You have to be CONSCIOUS in yourself. It is not a question of being hard or
nice to anybody – you have to be conscious inside yourself. And the first effect will be that you will
be nice to yourself. The first ripple of being conscious is being nice to oneself – the first ripple of
consciousness is self-love.
You wily be surprised to know this, because you have always been taught that self-love is a kind of
selfishness – it is not. It is the foundation of all altruistic love. Self-love is the BASE of all possible
love – love with your wife, love with your children, love with your God. Unless you love yourself you
cannot love anybody else.
Meditate over Jesus’ saying: Love thy neighbor as thyself. But thyself comes first. People have
started loving their neighbors and have forgotten that they don’t love themselves. So when you love
your neighbor and you don’t find him very loving – and you have to love him because you have been
taught, and this is good manners, and civilization and culture, respectability comes through it, and
you love your neighbor – you will hate yourself. Then the law of compensation will work.
And if you hate yourself, how can you love your neighbor? You can only pretend; only on the surface
can you show. Deep down, you would like to murder him. Deep down, you are full of hate. This is
the situation that has happened to humanity.
My approach is totally different: Be conscious! And the first ripple will be self-love, you will love
yourself, because you are closest to yourself. And it has to start there. Just as you throw a stone in
a silent lake and ripples arise, first they arise just around the stone, and then they spread towards
the bank. Then they go on spreading.....


Love yourself. For that you have to be very conscious. Only a conscious person can love himself,
because only a conscious person knows that ”I am not there, but God is.” How can you love yourself?
You don’t know who is there. You have not Even tasted anything there, you have not seen anybody
there. It is all darkness.
And you have been taught that you are ugly, that you are worthless: ”Improve upon yourself! Be
this! Be that!” Nobody has told you to accept yourself. Everybody has been telling you to reject
yourself, so you hate yourself and then you become hard with yourself. Hatred is hard. And then
whatsoever you go on thinking about, Deva Sharan, that ”I am soft and nice to others,” that softness
and niceness is hypocrisy, it is not true – it can’t be true.
A real niceness for others can arise only if you are nice with yourself. Start from there. Forget all
about what you have been told. Your priorities are all wrong. Don’t put the other as more important
than you. Nobody is more important than you. You are the most important person in the world, you
are the center of the world. And I am not telling you to become egoistic: I am simply saying a truth
– that each is a center to the whole world, to the whole universe. God exists in you, you have to
be the cent r. I am not saying that others are not centers – everybody is. But how are you going to
understand others’ significance if you don’t know your significance?
Love yourself. And out of that love a great love will arise for others, because they are also like you.
And the last question:
Question 6
WHAT IS THE TRADE SECRET OF THE PRIESTS? HOW HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO EXPLOIT
MAN FOR SO LONG?
IT IS VERY simple.Just a few stories will make it clear to you:
Two music students were discussing their part-time jobs. Said one, ”I work in the opera at night and
carry a spear in one act.”
His friend asked, ”How do you manage to keep awake so late at night?”
”It’s simple,” replied the first. ”The man behind me carries a spear too.”
The second story:
Preacher Pitts had undertaken that morning to describe the terrors of hell to his congregation.
”Brothers and sisters,” he intoned, ”some of you have seen melted iron running out of a furnace,
haven’t you? It’s white, sizzling and hissing. Well, in the place I’m talking about, they use that stuff
for ice cream.”
Reverend Walker stood before his congregation and in dynamic fashion pontificated on the
wickedness of intercourse. After twenty minutes of ranting about the sin of sex, he raised himself to full height, leaned over the pulpit, and boomed:


”Brothers and sisters, if there are any among you who have committed adultery, may your tongue cleave to the woof of your mowf.”
And if you make people afraid, you also become afraid. It works both ways. So it is not only that the priest has made you afraid – he himself has become afraid, he is also trembling.
Fear has been their trade secret. Create fear in people, and when people are frightened they are ready to become slaves, then they are ready to do anything. I
I Walt you to be absolutely free of fear. There is no fear. This existence is yours, there is no hell –
unless you decide to create one. Then it is a private affair. Then you can create it. But there is no
hell! It is all heaven. And heaven is not in the end when you reach God, no. Heaven is ALL the way
to, God. Each moment is heavenly. The whole journey is heavenly.
Heaven is a way of looking at things, and hell too. But in the past the fear has been used as a
trade secret. AND joined with fear is greed. That is another side of the same coin. One side is fear,
another side is greed. Both have been exploited. And a really religious person is one who is free of
fear and greed.
And if you are free of fear and greed, you will be free from the exploitations that have been going on
and on down the centuries. Because of it, religion has not been of any help to humanity; rather, it
has been a curse, it has not been a blessing. Make it a blessing. Drop fear and greed. Live joyously!
Live in a heavenly way THIS moment, now.
Live... Love... be... and forget ALL fears. There is nothing to be afraid of. We are part of this
existence. This existence is not antagonistic to us. It is very friendly. It has created us! How can it
be inimical? And there is nobody sitting there counting your sins, and nobody is there to punish you.
God is not to be feared.
And if there is fear, you cannot love. Fear kills all capacity to love. In all the languages of the world,
there are words like ’god fearing’ – they are ugly words. Drop them. Never use them. Let this religion
be a religion of love – be god loving. And then you are out of the grip and the trap of the priest.
And not only are you out of the grip and the trap of the priest – you will free the priest too. He is
also suffering with you. Continuously talking to you again and again about hell and heaven, he also
becomes convinced of it. It is not that only you are the victim – he is also a victim. It has become a
nightmare to all.
This is what I mean by a new religious consciousness in the world: free of fear and greed. The
whole energy has to be poured as celebration....
