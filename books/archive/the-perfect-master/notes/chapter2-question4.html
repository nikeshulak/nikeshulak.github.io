If you really want to communicate with your woman or a woman wants to communicate with her
man, the only way is that both should disappear from reason and emotion, both should become
more meditative. Meditation is neither reason nor emotion – it is going beyond, it is going beyond
the polarity. It is transcendental. Meditation takes you beyond reasoning and beyond emotions;
it is neither of the head nor of the heart. And the only possibility of any communion, of any
communication, between man and woman is meditation. Otherwise, there is no possibility.

And you feel right in yourself, and the woman feels right in herself. Different ways of thinking.
No one is right and no one is wrong – because ALL ways of thinking are wrong. A state of no-thought
is right. A state of no-emotion is right.
So when you love a woman and the woman loves you deeply, there is communion, because in that
love there is meditation.

But that love comes and goes. You are not yet capable enough of containing it forever, so the
honeymoon disappears soon. When you fall in love with a woman, everything goes well. You
both agree with each other. Never is there any argument. So understanding of each other, so
compassionate towards each other, so sympathetic. But after the honeymoon is over, then small
things... so small that when you want to talk about them you feel embarrassed.

A man of pure reason has no belief, no prejudice, no A PRIORI idea. He simply goes into inquiry
with no judgment, no conclusions . The inquiry will decide what the conclusion is. It will be decided
by the inquiry itself. If you have even a lurking desire to prove something, you will prove it, but you
have destroyed its scientificness. It is no longer reason. It is rational.


And so is emotion. Emotion is a purity; sentimentality is a trick. You have learnt a trick. The woman
knows that if she cries, she is the winner. Now, sometimes the crying is not coming at all, because
crying is not so easily manipulated. But she tries to bring it, she acts, she pretends. Those tears are
false. Even if they are flowing through the eyes, they are false – because they are not coming, they
are being brought.
Sentimentality is emotion created, manipulated, cunningly. Rationality is one thing; rationalization is
a manipulation of reason just as sentimentality is a manipulation of emotion. If you are rational,
REALLY rational, you will become a scientist. If you are really emotional, you will become a
poet. These are beautiful things. But still, dialogue will not be possible – it will be easier. With
rationalization and sentimentality it is very difficult, but with reason and emotion it is not so difficult
– still there will be difficulties, but there will be compassion, an effort to understand each other.
The rational man will try to understand the woman’s viewpoint rationally; and the woman will try to
understand the man’s viewpoint – emotionally, of course, but compassion will be there.
First step is: drop all rationalizations and all sentimentalities. And the second step is: drop reason
and emotion too. And then in that state of ecstasy, of meditation, there is communion. And that
communion is prayer. In that communion when you say ’thou’, there is no woman, there is God;
there is no man, there is God.
