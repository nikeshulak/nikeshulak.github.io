THEY ARE RIGHT! YOU HAVE GONE CRAZY. They have a certain idea of what sanity is. Because
of that idea, they cannot say that you are sane. If you are sane, then they are insane. That idea can
allow sanity to only one: either to them or to you. And who is willing to lose his own sanity?
They said the same thing to Jesus, ”You are mad.” They said the same thing to Socrates, ”You are
mad.” They say the same thing to me, that I am mad. They will say the same thing to you, that you
are mad. They are not really saying anything about you; they are simply saying that your presence
creates a disturbance in them. Your very presence makes them suspicious of their sanity.
And, naturally, the suspicion becomes very very strong because you are joyful and you are happy
and you are celebrating and they are miserable. Sanity should give people joy. It has not given them
joy. They become suspicious, doubtful. Whenever they come across a person who is really joyous,


they become suspicious of their whole life-style: ”Is there something wrong in it?” And, naturally, to
defend their life-style they have to say to you that you are wrong. That is their defense measure.
Don’t be angry at them, just understand their problem.
Their problem is that their whole way of life is at stake because of your presence. They will call you
mad. And if it becomes too difficult for them to tolerate your presence, they will murder you. They
did that to Jesus. They have been doing that to thousands of mystics down the ages. And I am
trying my best to transform you into a mystic.
This sannyas is no ordinary phenomenon. It is a quantum leap into the mysteries of life. And, of
course, I am giving you a totally different vision. They are bound to react. And they will be hard with
you.

By becoming a sannyasin you have entered into a new vision. That vision will be constantly in a
world which is not supporting it, which cannot support it. You will not be supported by the people.
You will be colliding with them. So you have to learn one thing: when you are with people, don’t
be too joyous. Keep it in. And don’t try to talk about the dimension of depth – unless somebody is
willing to hear it. ACT as if you are sad. ACT as if you are a long face. ACT that you are a dead
saint. Avoid people.When you want to dance, dance alone.
And this is not a new teaching I am giving to you. Sufis have always said it, that when you pray, pray
when you are alone. Nobody should hear it, nobody should know about it. Not even your wife! In
the middle of the night, wake up and bow down in immense joy, delight. Don’t let the woman know,
because she will talk to the neighbors tomorrow and the thing will go around, exaggerated in many
ways. And you will be in trouble.
These people are living a very sad life, neurotic, not healthy at all, pathological. So when somebody
turns to being healthy, he has to be very alert.

To live with these mad people, even for three months, one needs to be mad.
You are living with a certain kind of world, a flat world, joyless, depth less, superficial. People’s
lives are just trivial. They live for money or for power, prestige – which are all meaningless. In the
ultimate reckoning they carry no weight. Death comes and all money and all power and all prestige
disappear – and you are thrown to the dustbin. Nobody ever remembers you again. You may have
been a prime minister or a president of a country – nobody cares a bit. You may have been the
richest man in the world, but death is very communistic.Whether you are a beggar or a rich man,
death treats everyone equally. It comes and destroys all, without any exception.
People are living in a flat world. So when you start moving into the dimension of depth, you have to
be a little alert – otherwise you will be in trouble from the outside. The inner joy will grow, and as it
grows, the outer conflict will grow proportionately. So unless you enjoy that conflict, act as if nothing
has happened to you. Only share your joy with those who understand.
That’s why sat sang is immensely valuable. You can share your joy with other orange people. They
will understand. They will be happy. They will be joyous through your joy. They will SEE what has
happened to you. But don’t go on sharing it with those who don’t understand – unless you enjoy it.
If you enjoy it, then it is perfectly okay.

_

All that you can do, and all that is needed is: don’t become like them. Do everything, take every
precaution. If you feel a very strong desire to share with people who don’t understand, then move
into that knowing perfectly well that they will treat you the same as they have always treated others.
Go knowingly into it; then if they start throwing stones at you, don’t complain. This is your choice. If
they crucify you, don’t complain. This is what you have chosen of your own accord.

Always remember with whom you are talking... otherwise you will create trouble for yourself.
