ANAHATA, NO ANSWER IS GOING TO HELP – that s why the desire remains. A question arises,
and if you silently wait it is bound to happen that the answer will arise. In fact, the answer is there,
that’s why the question has arisen. The answer is there before the question has arisen in you.
The answer is hiding in the question itself. If you go deeply into the question you will find the answer.
The question is nothing but a hard shell around the answer. You will always find the answer if you
wait long enough. And if you wait silently. But still, no answer is going to help – that’s why the desire
to ask remains.
One has to go beyond questions AND beyond answers – because coach answer will create new
questions in its own turn. So if one question is answered, the answer will create ten questions in its
turn... and so on and so forth. And you can go on and on. And you can go on chasing and chasing,
and you will never arrive.
When all questions disappear – and not only questions but all answers too – then the desire to ask
will disappear. Never before it.

In fact, if you go deep into your own questions you need not ask anybody. All asking is unnecessary,
because whatsoever answer I give to you is really there inside you. I only make it apparent. I help


it to surface in you. I have no ready-made answer for you. I have no catechism. It is not that my
answer is fixed for ever.
You ask the question. I look into your question.
I try to do what you should have done yourself, and then find the answer there, and I make it clear
to you. The work of a Master is to make your OWN answers clear to you. He brings rarity, he does
not give you any answers. A Master is not a scholar, he is not a professor. He does not give you
answers. He simply brings clarity, vision, capacity to see.
So if you are here... as Anahata IS here, and he has been listening to me, and the clarity is growing,
and the transparency is growing. So whenever a question arises in him, suddenly the answer is
there. This is beautiful. This is how it should be – to everybody. Then I will be spared the trouble.
But remember: it is not a question of questions being answered. Something more is needed. Only
that ’something more’ will be the manna that will satisfy you, fulfill you, quench your thirst. That
transmission – that transmission of energy from a Master to the disciple, like the flame jumping from
the lit candle to the unlit candle. It is not a question of answer or question. It is not verbal, it is not
intellectual. It is existential.
It is needed that a flame jumps from me to you, so you also become aflame, afire, so that your inner
being is no more in darkness. In darkness all kinds of questions arise. If you become a little more
intelligent, clear, alert, aware, you will find the answers.
But each answer will bring many more questions. It is an infinite process, AD NAUSEA. You can go
on and on.... That is not going to transform you. That’s why, Anahata, the desire to ask still remains.
