LET YOURSELF BE VULNERABLE

Lao Tzu says:

When man is born, he is tender and weak; at death, he is hard and stiff. When
things and plants are alive, they are soft and supple; when they are dead, they are
brittle and dry. Therefore hardness and stiffness are the companions of death, and softness and gentleness are the companions of life.

Therefore when an army is headstrong, it will lose in battle. When a tree is
hard, it will be cut down. The big and strong belong underneath. The gentle and weak
belong at the top.

Life is a river, a flow, a continuum with no beginning and no end. It is not going
somewhere, it is always here. It is not going from somewhere to somewhere else, it is always coming from here to here. The only time for life is now, and the only place is here. There is no struggle to reach, there is nothing to reach. There is no struggle to conquer, there is nothing to conquer. There is no effort to protect, because there is nothing to be protected from. Only life exists, alone, absolutely alone, beautiful in its aloneness, majestic in its aloneness.

You can live life in two ways: You can flow with it—then you are also majestic, you
have a grace, a grace of nonviolence, no conflict, no struggle. Then you have a beauty, childlike, flowerlike, soft, delicate, uncorrupted. If you flow with life, you are religious.

That's what religion means to Lao Tzu, or to me.

Ordinarily religion means a fight with life, for God. Ordinarily it means God is the goal,
and life has to be denied and fought. Life has to be sacrificed, and God has to be achieved.

This ordinary religion is no religion. This ordinary religion is just part of the ordinary,
violent, aggressive mind.

There is no God beyond life; life is God. If you deny life, you deny God; if you
sacrifice life, you sacrifice God. In all the sacrifices, only God is sacrificed. George Gurdjieff
used to say—it looks paradoxical, but it is true—that all religions are against God. If life is
God, then to deny, to renounce, to sacrifice is to go against God. But it seems Gurdjieff did not know much about Lao Tzu. Or even if he had known about Lao Tzu,
he would have said the same thing because Lao Tzu does not seem to be ordinarily religious.

He is more like a poet, a musician, an artist, a creator than a theologian, a priest, a preacher,
philosopher. He is so ordinary that you cannot think that he is religious. But, really, to be
religious is to be so extraordinarily ordinary in life that the part is not against the whole, but
the part is flowing with the whole. To be religious is not to be separate from the flow.

To be irreligious is to have your own mind in
an effort to win, to conquer, to reach somewhere. If
you have a goal, you are irreligious. If you are
thinking of the tomorrow, you have already missed
religion. Religion has no tomorrow to it. That's why
Jesus says, "Think not of the morrow. Look at the
lilies in the field, they are blossoming now." Every-
thing that is, is now. Everything that is alive is alive
now. Now is the only time, the only eternity.

There are two possibilities. One way is you can
fight with life, you can have your private goals
against life— and all goals are private, all goals are
personal. You are trying to impose a pattern on life, something of your own. You are trying
to drag life to follow you and you are just a tiny part, infinitesimal, so small, and you are
trying to drag the whole universe with you. Of course you are bound to be defeated. You are
bound to lose your grace, you are bound to become hard.

Fighting creates hardness. Just think of fight, and a subtle hardness comes around you. Just think of resisting, and a crust arises around you, which covers you
like a cocoon. The very idea that you have a certain goal makes you an island; you are no
longer part of the vast continent of life. And when you are separated from life, you are like a
tree that is separated from the earth. It may live a little of the past nourishment, but really it is
dying. The tree needs roots; the tree needs to be in the earth, joined with it, part of it.

You need to be joined with the continent of life, part
of it, rooted in it. When you are rooted in life, you are soft
because you are not afraid. Fear creates hardness. Fear
creates the idea of security, fear creates the idea of
protecting yourself. And nothing kills like fear because in
the very idea of fear you are separated from the earth,
uprooted.

Then you live on the past—that is why you think so
much of the past. It is not coincidental. The mind
continuously thinks either of the past or of the future. Why
think so much of the past? The gone is gone! It cannot be
recovered. The past is dead! Why do you go on thinking
about the past, which is no more and about which nothing
can be done? You cannot live it, you cannot be in it, but it
can destroy your present moment. But there must be some deep-rooted cause for it. The
deep-rooted cause is that you are fighting the whole. Fighting the whole, fighting the river of
life, you are uprooted. You have become tiny, a capsulelike phenomenon, closed in yourself.

You have become an individual, you are no longer part of the expanding universe, the vast. No, you are no longer part of it. You have to
live like a miser on your past nourishment; that's why the mind goes on thinking about the
past.

And you have to gather yourself somehow to be ready to fight; that's why you also go
on thinking about the future. Future gives you hope, past gives you nourishment, and just
between the two is eternity, the very life, which you are missing. Between the past and the
future you are dying, not living.

There is another way to be—really, the only way to be because this way is not the way
to be; the way of fight is not to be the way to be. The other way is to flow with the river, flow
so together with it that you don't feel that you are separate and flowing with it. No, you
become part of it—not only part, you are immersed in it; you have become the river, there
exists no separation. When you are not fighting, you become life. When you are not fighting,
you have become the vast, the infinite. In the East that state has been known as surrender,
trust—what we have called shraddha, trusting life. Not trusting your individual mind but
trusting the whole. Not trusting the part but the whole. Not trusting the mind but trusting
existence. Surrendered, suddenly you become soft because then there is no need to be hard.

You are not fighting, there is no enmity There is no need to protect, there is no urge to be
secure; you are already merged with life.

And life is secure! Only individual egos are insecure; they need protection, they need
safety, they need armor around them. They are afraid, continuously trembling—then how can
you live? You live in anguish and anxiety, you don't live. You lose all delight, the sheer joy
of being here—and it is a sheer joy. It has no cause to it; it simply arises because you are. It
simply bubbles up within you just because you are. Once you are open, flowing with life, you are bubbling with joy continuously, for
no reason at all! You simply start feeling that to be is to be happy
That's why Hindus have called the ultimate satchitananda—truth, consciousness,
bliss. It means that to be is to be blissful, to be true is to be blissful. There is no other way
of being. If you are miserable, that only shows that you have lost contact with being. To be
miserable means somehow you are uprooted from the earth; you have become separate
from the river, you have become a frozen block, an ice cube, floating in the river but not
with it. Fighting, even trying to go upstream—the ego always wants to go upstream because
wherever there is challenge, the ego feels good. The ego is always in search of fight. If you
cannot find anybody to fight, you will feel very miserable. Somebody is needed to fight. In
fighting you feel good, you are. But that is a pathological way, a neurotic way to be.

Neurosis is fighting with the river. If you fight, you become hard. If you fight, you surround
yourself with a dead wall. Of course, your own being is dead. You lose softness, lucidity,
grace, gentleness. Then you are just dragging, not alive.

Lao Tzu is for surrender. He says, "Surrender to life. Allow life to lead you, don't try
to lead life. Don't try to manipulate and control life, let life manipulate and control you. Let
life possess you. You simply surrender, you simply say, 'I am not.' You give total power to
life, and be with it."
It is difficult, because the ego says, "Then what am I? Surrendered, I am no more." But
when the ego is not, in fact for the first time you . are. For the first time you are not the
finite, you are the infinite. For the first time you are not the body, the embodied, you are the
unem-bodied, the vast, which goes on expanding—beginningless, endless.

But the ego does not know about it. The ego is afraid. It says,
"What are you doing, losing yourself? You will be lost, you will be a nobody." If you listen to the

ego, the ego will put you again and again on a neurotic path, the path of being "somebody." And the
more you become somebody, the more life has disappeared from you. Look at people who have
succeeded in the world, who have become somebody, whose names are found in Who's Who. Look at

them, watch them: You will find that they are living a fake life. They are only masks, nothing inside,
hollow men—stuffed maybe, but not alive. Empty.


Watch people who have become successful in the world, who have become somebodies—

presidents, prime ministers, the very rich—who have attained all that can be attained in the world.

Watch them, touch them, look at them; you will feel death. You will not find throbbing hearts there.

Maybe the heart is still beating, but the beat is mechanical. The beat has lost the poetry They look at

you, but their eyes are dull; the luster of being alive is not there. They will shake hands with you, but
in their hands you will not feel anything flowing, you will not feel any exchange of energy, you will
not see warmth welcoming you. A dead hand—weight you will find there, love you will not find.

Look around them; they live in hell. They have succeeded, they have become somebodies, and now
only hell surrounds them. You are on the same path if you are trying to be somebody.

Lao Tzu says, be a nobody, and then you will have infinite life flowing in you. For the flow of
life, to be a somebody becomes a block. To be a nobody, a vast emptiness, allows all. Clouds can
move, stars can move in it. And nothing disturbs it. And you have nothing to lose because all that can
be lost you have surrendered already.


In such a state of being one is ever young. The body, of course, will become old, but the
innermost core of your being remains young, fresh. It never becomes old, it is never dead. And Lao

Tzu says this is the way to be really religious. Float with Tao, move with Tao, don't create any private goals and ends. The whole knows better; you are simply with it. The whole has created you, the whole breathes within you, the whole lives in you. Why do you bother? Let the responsibility be with the whole. You simply go wherever it leads. Don't try to force and plan, and don't ask for any certain goals because then there will be frustration, and you will become hard, and you will miss an opportunity of being alive.

And this is the point: If you allow life, more life happens. Then if you allow yourself to be alive, still more life happens. Jesus goes on saying, "Come to me, and I will show you the way of infinite life, life abundant. Life overflowing, flooding." But we live like beggars. We could have been like emperors, nobody else is responsible. Your cleverness to be yourself, to be clinging to the ego, is the whole cause of your misery.

Now the sutras:


When man is born, he is tender and weak.



Watch a small baby, just born. He has no crust around him. He is vulnerable, open,
soft—life in its purity. It will not be so for long, soon personalities will start growing around
him, he will be encaged, imprisoned by society, parents, schools, universities; soon life will
become a distant phenomenon. He will be more like a prisoner. Life will go on beating
somewhere deep inside him, but even he will not be able to hear the beat of it.

But when a child is born, watch it. Again and again the miracle happens. Again and
again life goes on showing you the way, how to be, again and again life goes on saying that
life is renewed every day. Old men die, new small babies are born. What is the point in it? It
is very clear that life does not believe in oldness. In fact, if life were run by economists, this would seem to be very uneconomical, a wastage. An old man—trained,
experienced in the ways of life and world— when he is ready, when he thinks he has
become wise, death takes over and replaces the old man with a small baby with no
knowledge, no wisdom at all, absolutely fresh, a tabula rasa; everything has to be written
again. If you ask the economists, they will say this is foolish! God should consult
economists first. What is he doing? It is a waste, sheer waste! A trained man of eighty dies,
and an untrained babe is replacing him—this should be just the opposite; then it will be
more economical.

But life does not believe in economics. And it is good that it doesn't believe, otherwise
the whole world would have become a big cemetery. It believes in life, not in economics. It
goes on replacing old people with the new, dead people with the young, hard people with
the soft. The indication is clear: Life loves softness because through a soft being life can
flow easily


When man is born, he is tender and weak.



And Lao Tzu insists on the second point also: that life
does not believe in strength. Weakness has a beauty in it
because it is tender and soft. A storm comes; big, strong
trees will fall. Small plants will simply bend, and then the
storm goes by, and they are again smiling and flowering. In
fact, the storm has freshened them, it has taken their dust,
that's all. They are more alive, younger, fresher, and the
storm has given them a





good bath. And the old trees, very strong, have fallen because they resisted. They would not
bend; they were very egoistic.

Lao Tzu says, "Life loves the weak." And that is the meaning of Jesus' saying, "Blessed
are the meek because they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are the poor, the poor in spirit.

Blessed are those who weep because they shall be comforted." Christianity goes on missing
the meaning of Jesus' sayings because those sayings are Lao Tzuan. Unless they are related
to Lao Tzu, they cannot be interpreted rightly. The whole teaching of Jesus is, "Be alive and
be weak." That's why he says if somebody hits you on the face, give him the other side, too.

If somebody takes your coat, give him your shirt, too. And if somebody forces you to walk
with him for one mile, go for two miles. He is saying, "Be weak. Blessed are the meek."
What is there in weakness that is blessed? Because ordinarily the so-called leaders of
the world, the teachers of the world, go on saying, "Be strong." And this Lao Tzu and this
Jesus, they say, "Be weak." Weakness has something in it—because it is not hard. To be
strong, one-needs to be hard. To be hard, one needs to go against life. If you want to be
strong, you will have to fight the flow; only then will you become strong. There is no other
way to become strong. If you want to become strong, move upcurrent. The more the river
forces you against it, the stronger you become. To be weak, flow with the river; wherever it
is going, go with it. If the river says, "Go with me for one mile," go two miles. If the river
takes your coat, also give your shirt, And if the river slaps you on one cheek, give the other.

Weakness has a certain beauty in it. The beauty is that of grace. The beauty is that of
nonviolence, ahimsa. The beauty is that of love, forgiveness. The beauty is that of no
conflict. And unless Lao Tzu is understood well and humanity starts feeling for Lao Tzu,
humanity cannot live in peace.

If you are taught to be strong, you are bound to fight, wars will continue. All political
leaders in the world go on saying that they love peace—
and they all prepare for war. They say they stand for
peace— and they all go on accumulating armaments.

They talk about peace, and they prepare for war, and they
all say they have to prepare for war because they are
afraid of the other. And the other says the same thing!
The whole thing looks so foolish and stupid. China is
afraid of India, India is afraid of China. Why can't you
see the point! Russia is afraid of America, America is
afraid of Russia. They both talk about peace, and they
both go on preparing for war. And, of course, that which
you prepare for happens.

Your talk about peace looks like just rubbish. Your
talk about peace is nothing but cold war. In fact,
politicians need time to prepare—in that time they talk about peace so that they can have
enough time to prepare. For centuries humanity has lived in only two periods: the period of
war and the period of preparation for war. These are the only two periods. The whole history
seems to be just neurotic.

But this is going to be so because strength is praised, ego is praised. If two persons are
fighting on the road, one is stronger, another is Weak—the weaker has fallen, and the
stronger is sitting on his chest— whom do you appreciate? Do you appreciate the one who
has become a conqueror? Then you are violent; then you are for war. Then you are a
warmonger; then you are very dangerous and neurotic. Or do you appreciate the one who is
weak? But nobody appreciates the weak;

nobody wants to be associated with the weak because deep
down you would also like to be strong.

When you appreciate the strong, you say, "Yes, this is
my ideal; I would also like to be like him." If strength is
praised, then violence is praised. If strength is praised, then
death is praised because all strength kills—kills the other
and also kills you. Strength is murderous and suicidal both.

Weakness—the very word seems to be condemnatory.

But what is weakness? A flower is weak. A rock by the side
of the flower is very strong. Would you like to be like a
rock, or would you like to be like a flower? A flower is
weak, remember, very weak— just a small wind and the
flower will be gone. The petals will fall to the earth. A
flower is a miracle; it is a miracle how the flower exists. So
weak, so soft! Seems to be impossible—how is it possible? Rocks seem to be okay; they
exist, they have their arithmetic to exist. But the flower? It seems to be completely
unsupported—but still a flower exists; that's the miracle.

Would you like to be like a flower? If you ask, deep down your ego will say, "Be like a
rock." And even if you insist, because a rock looks ugly, then the ego will say, "If you want
to be a flower, be at least a plastic flower. Be at least strong! Winds won't disturb you, rains
won't destroy you, and you can remain forever and ever." A real flower comes in the
morning, laughs for a moment, spreads its fragrance, arid is gone. An unreal flower, a plastic
flower, can remain forever and





ever. But it is unreal, and it is strong because it is unreal.

Reality is soft and weak. And the higher the reality is, the
softer.

You cannot understand God because your mind
understands the logic of rocks. You don't understand the
logic     of   a   flower.   Your   mind    can    understand
mathematics. You don't have that aesthetic sense to feel
for flowers. Only a poetic mind can understand the
possibility of God, because God is the weakest and the
softest. That's why it is the highest, it is the ultimate
flower. It flowers, but it flowers only in a split second.

That split second is known as "the present." And it is
such a small moment that you need to be intensely
attentive. Only then will you be able to see it; otherwise
you will miss it. It is always flowering—every moment it
flowers, but you cannot see because your mind is cluttered with the past and the future. And
the present is such a narrow phenomenon, just a flicker of the eyelids and it is gone. In that
narrow moment God flowers.

It is the highest, the ultimate. But it is very weak, very soft—it has to be. It is the
pinnacle, the last crescendo beyond which nothing exists. You will be able to understand
God only when you understand the logic of softness and weakness. If you are trying to be
strong—conquerors, fighters, warriors—then you will live in the World surrounded by rocks,
not flowers, and God will be a faraway phenomenon. It will not be possible for you to detect
God anywhere in life.

When man is born, he is tender and weak; at death, he is hard and tiff.



So this should become your life: Remain soft, tender, and weak; don't try to be hard and
stiff because that is how you are bringing your own death closer and closer. Death will come
someday; that is not the point. Death is not the fear, death is not the problem. But if you are
alive in a deathlike personality, that is the problem. Death in itself is very soft, softer than
life, very tender. You can hear the sounds of life, but you cannot hear the sounds of death.

When death comes,
it is so soft that you cannot know even a second before
that it is corning. And it is so weak, so tender, that death
is not the problem. The death that you are living right
now, that is the problem. Death before death is the
problem; living a dead life, that is the problem. Hard,
closed. Leibniz has a term for it. He calls it monad.

Monad means closed in such a prison, in such a capsule,
that there are no windows to look out of or for the outside
to look in. A monad is an absolutely closed, windowless
cell. Monad comes from the same root as monopoly,
monastery, monk, and monogamy; it means to be totally
alone. A monk is one who lives alone, a monastery is a
place where people live alone. When you are completely
closed, in a dead cell, you are in a monastery. You live in
a cave by yourself, you cannot reach others, others cannot reach you. You are completely
closed.





This is the death that is stiff. And then you are miserable, and then you try to find ways
and means how not to be miserable. You go on creating misery by being stiff, hard, and then
you go on seeking methods how not to be miserable. In fact, if you understand the phenom-
enon of how you have become miserable, you can drop it immediately just be soft, flowing.

Be like a child, and always retain the purity and the softness of childhood. Don't lose
contact with it, and you will be surprised one day when you discover that the child that you
had been fifty years ago is still alive within you. If you know how to make contact with it,
suddenly you are again a child.

The child is never lost because that is your life, it remains there. It is not that the child
dies and then you become young, and then the youth dies, and then you become old, no.

Layers upon layers accu-. mulate, but the innermost core remains the same—the babe that
you were born is still there within you; many layers have accumulated around it, and if you
penetrate those layers, suddenly the child explodes in you. This explosion I have called
ecstasy.

Jesus says, "Unless you become like children you
will not enter the kingdom of God." This is what he
means, and this is what I am talking about. If you
penetrate your hard shell, the walls around you, the many
layers, suddenly the child will explode within you. Again
you will look at the world with those innocent eyes of a
child. Then there is God.

God is not a very philosophical con-cept; it is this
world looked at through the eyes of a child. The same
world— these flowers, these trees, this sky, and




you—the same world suddenly takes on a new quality of being divine when you look at it
through the eyes of a child. Only a pure, soft, tender heart is needed. God is not missing, you
are missing. God is not absent, you are absent.



When man is born, he is tender and weak; at death, he is hard and stiff. When
things and plants are alive, they are soft and supple; when they are dead, they are
brittle and dry.



Learn. Life is teaching through many ways. Life is indicating the path how one should
be.



Therefore hardness and stiffness are the companions of death, and softness and
gentleness are the companions of life.



If you want to be more alive, abundantly alive, then seek companions of life:
gentleness, softness.

All that clutters you makes you hard. Live in such a
way that each moment you are free from the past moment.

Your situation right now
is like this: You have a big house with many rooms, and
in all the rooms there are jigsaw puzzles. The whole house
is filled with jigsaw puzzles—on the tables, on the chairs,
on the beds, on the floors, hanging from the ceilings—
everywhere jigsaw puzzles, and you have not been able to
solve any. You try to solve one; feeling that to solve it is
difficult, you move to another puzzle. But the first one is
hanging on your head. Not only that,




a few parts of it you carry with you to work on later on. Then you try to solve another puzzle,
but you cannot solve it because you are yourself puzzled. Then you move to another room,
and in this way you go on and on and on, in circles.

You are cluttered with unsolved puzzles, and by and by you are completely neurotic.

Not a single point of life solved, and thousands of puzzles hanging around you. They take
their toll. They kill you.

Never carry things on from the past—the past
is gone. Every moment be rid of it, solved or not
solved. Now nothing can be done about it. Drop it—
and don't carry parts because those parts won't allow
you to solve new problems that live in this moment.

Live this moment as totally as possible, and
suddenly you will come to realize that if you live it
totally, it is solved. There is no need to solve it. Life
is not a problem to be solved, it is a mystery to be
lived. If you live it totally it is solved, and you come
out of it beautiful, enriched, with new treasures of
your being opened and nothing hanging around you.

Then you move in another moment with that
freshness, with this totality, intensity, so that
another moment is lived and solved.

Never go on accumulating unlived moments
around you; otherwise you will become hard. You
can remain soft only if you don't carry anything
from the past. Why are children soft? They don't carry anything. Their way is the way of the
sage. If a child is angry, he is


  121


angry. In that moment he does not bother what Buddha says about anger. He does not bother
with what Mahavira has taught about anger, "Don't be angry." He becomes really angry! He
is so intensely angry that the very intensity becomes beautiful. Look at a child when he is
really angry, the whole body—such a small body, so soft, so tender— throbbing with anger,
eyes red, face red, jumping, screaming, as if he will destroy the whole world. An explosion
of energy . . . And the next moment the anger is gone and he is playing, and look at his
face— you cannot believe that this face was so angry a moment before. All smiles! So
beautiful, so happy
This is the way to live. One moment be in it, but be
in it so totally that nothing is left over to be in another
moment. The child
lives the moment of anger; then he moves. When better
education is possible in the world, we will not teach chil-
dren not to be angry. We will teach them to be angry but
totally angry—and not to carry it. Anger in itself is not
bad. To carry it, to accumulate it, is dangerous. Flashes
of anger are beautiful—in fact, necessary; they give a
tone to life. They make life more salty. Otherwise you
will feel flaccid; you won't have a tone. It is good
exercise in itself, and if one can be in it totally and come
out of it totally, unscratched, nothing is wrong in it.

And a person who can be angry totally can be
happy totally, can be loving totally because it is not a
question of whether you are angry or happy or lov-






ing. The one thing you learn from all experiences is being total. If you are not allowed to be
angry, you become incomplete. You live the moment partially, the other parts hang on the
mind. Then you are smiling but your smile is not pure; it is corrupted because that anger is
hanging in it. Your lips are smiling, but they are poisonous; the anger has not left, the past
has not gone, you are not completely free to be here and now. The past has cast a shadow on
you. And this goes on and on. You become puzzled. The whole of life becomes a hangover.

Then you cannot live anything, you cannot love, you cannot pray, you cannot meditate.

People come to me and they say, "When we meditate, suddenly millions of thoughts
arise. Ordinarily those thoughts are not arising, but when we meditate, then they arise." Why
does it happen? Incomplete experiences—when you meditate you are unoccupied, and they
all jump upon you: "You are unoccupied, at least solve us, complete us, fulfill us. You are
not doing anything—meditation is not doing anything, just sitting here. Do something! This
anger is there, resolve it. This love is there, fulfill it. This desire is there, do something!"
When you are occupied, you are so occupied that these things all surround you but
never become the focus of your attention. But when you are meditating, they all try to attract
your attention—"We are incomplete!" They are ghosts of your past.

Live every moment totally. And live with awareness, so that the past is not carried. And
this is easy, just a little awareness is needed— nothing else is needed. Don't live in sleep,
robotlike; be a little more conscious, and you will be able to see. And then you will become
soft like a child, supple like a new, sprouting plant. And this quality can be carried to the
very last moment of death; you remain supple. If you remain supple, young, fresh, death
happens, but it does not happen to you. Because you carry life in you, death cannot happen.

Only people






who have already been dead, die. People who have remained alive . . . they watch death
happening—the body dies, the mind dies, but not them. They remain out of it,
transcendental.



Therefore when an army is headstrong, it will lose in battle.



Lao Tzu looks absurd. He says when an army is headstrong it will lose in battle, and
you think whenever you are headstrong you will win.



When a tree is hard, it will be cut down. The big and strong belong underneath. The
gentle and weak belong at the top.



The roots are hard, they belong underneath. The flowers are soft, they belong at the top.

And this is the right structure of society: If the people who are strong belong to the roots, and
the people who are soft belong to the top. Poets and painters should belong to the top. Saints
and sages should belong to the highest peak. Soldiers, politicians, businessmen should belong
underneath; they should not belong to the top. The whole world is topsy-turvy because hard
people are trying to be on the top.

It is as if roots have become politicians, and they are trying to come to the top of the
tree, and they are trying to force the flowers to go to the roots, to the underground. Once the
world was more in equilibrium—for example in India, the Brahmins belonged to the top. We
had placed them at the top. Brahmins are sages, those who have known the Brahma. It is not
a caste, it has nothing to do with birth; it has to do with the inner resurrection. Those who
have known the ultimate are the Brahmans. They belonged to the top, they were the flowers.

Even kings, very strong emperors, had to come and bow down at their feet. That was the
right way—a king, howsoever strong and




howsoever great, is still a king. A man of the world is still neurotic, is still after ambition and
ego; he has to bow down. It happened:


Buddha was coming to a town, and the king of the town was a little hesitant to go
and receive him. The prime minister, a very old, wise man, told the king, "You
have to go." The king said, "This looks unnecessary. He is a beggar. Let him
come! What is the point in me going to the boundary of my kingdom to receive
him? I am a king, and he is a beggar."
The old prime minister wrote his resignation immediately. He said, "Take my
resignation because if you have fallen so low, then I cannot remain here. You must
remember that you are a king, and he has renounced kingdoms. He has nothing.

You have a great empire, and he has nothing. He belongs to the top. And you have
to go and bow down, otherwise take my resignation. I cannot be here in this palace
with you. That is impossible for me." The king had to go.

When he bowed down to Buddha, Buddha said to him, "There was no need. I
have heard that you were reluctant to come. There was no need because when one
is reluctant, even if one comes, one does not come. And respect cannot be forced.

Either you understand or you don't understand. There was no need—I was coming
myself to see you. And I am a beggar. . . you are an emperor."
Now the king started crying and weeping. He understood the point.



In the East, Brahmans were on the top. That should be the right ^ay to structure a
society. Now all over the world politicians have

                                  Intimacy

reached to the top. Hence the misery and the chaos—it has
to be so. The top has become too heavy. Only flowers
should be on the top—sages, poets, mystics. Not
politicians.



The big and strong belong underneath. The gentle and
weak belong at the top.



Lao Tzu is saying that if you want to belong to the top,
be gentle and weak. Be so weak and gentle, so soft like the
grass, not strong like big trees.

Lao Tzu has a deep interest in all that is useless. He
says to be useless is to be protected. To be useful is danger-
ous because if you are useful, then somebody is going to
use you, you will be exploited. If you are strong, then you
will be forced into the army.



Lao Tzu was passing through a village with his
disciples and saw a man with a hunchback. He told his disciples, "Go to that
hunchback and ask how he is feeling because I have heard the town has been in
trouble. The king has forced all young men and strong men into the army."
They went to the hunchback and they asked him. The hunchback said, "I am
happy! Because of my back, they didn't force me. I am useless. That's how I am
saved." The disciples





reported back. Lao Tzu said to them, "Now, remember. Be useless. Otherwise you
will become fodder in the war."
Once passing through a forest they came under a huge tree; one thousand
bullock carts could have rested underneath it. The whole forest was being cut
down, thousands of carpenters were working there. Lao Tzu said, "Inquire what
has happened—why have they not cut this big tree?"
The disciples went and inquired. The carpenter said, "That tree is absolutely
useless. The branches are not straight, you cannot make furniture out of them—and
when you burn it so much smoke comes out of it that it cannot be used as a fuel.

And the leaves are so bitter that not even animals are ready to eat them. So it is
useless. That is why we have not cut it down."
Lao Tzu started laughing and said to his disciples, "Be like that tree, useless.

Then nobody will cut you down. And look at this tree, how big it has become, just
by being useless!"

Life can be looked at in two ways. You can look at it as utilitarian: One thing has to be used for something else—then life becomes a means, and some end has to be fulfilled. Or life can be taken as enjoyment, not as a utility—then this moment is all, there is no goal, no purpose.

I was reading a poem just the other day. One line of it struck me deeply. "A poem should not mean, but be." I loved it. Life should not mean; life should be! An end in itself, going nowhere . . . enjoying here and now, celebrating. Only then can you be soft. If you are trying to be of use, you will become hard. If you are trying to achieve something, you will become hard. If you are trying to fight, you will become hard. Surrender. Be soft and tender.

And allow the flow of life to take you wherever it takes you. Let the goal of the whole be your goal. Don't seek any private goal. Just be a part, and an infinite beauty and grace happens.

Try to feel it, what I am saying. It is not a question of understanding, it is not a question of intellectual capacity. Feel it, what I am saying. Imbibe it, what I am saying. Let it be there with you. Allow it to settle deep in your being: Life should not mean; life should be. And then suddenly you are soft. All hardness goes, disappears, melts. The baby is rediscovered; you have again become a child, those transparent eyes of childhood are available again. You can look, and then the greenery is totally different. The songs of the birds are totally different. Then the whole has a totally different significance. It has no meaning, it has significance. Meaning is concerned with utility; significance, with delight.

Delight in it and you will be soft. Flow with the river. Become the river.
