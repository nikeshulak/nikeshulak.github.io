FIRST THINGS FIRST
THE ABC OF INTIMACY

    People are searching for meditation, prayer, new ways of being. But the
    deeper search, and the more basic search, is how to get rooted in existence
    again. Call it meditation, call it prayer, or whatever you will, but the
    essential thing is how to get rooted in existence again. We have become trees
    that are uprooted—and nobody else is responsible except us, with our own
    stupid idea of conquering nature.
         We are part of nature—how can the part conquer the whole? Befriend it,
    love it, trust it, and slowly, slowly in that friendship, in that love, in that trust,
    intimacy arises; you come closer. Nature comes closer to you, and nature starts
    revealing its secrets. Its ultimate secret is godliness. It is revealed only to those
    who are really friends of existence.


START WHERE YOU ARE

Life is a search—a constant search, a desperate search, a hopeless search, a
       search for something one knows not what. There is a deep urge to seek, but one
       knows not what one is seeking. And there is a certain state of mind in which
whatsoever you get is not going to give you any satisfaction. Frustration seems to be
the destiny

                                              1

of humanity because whatsoever you get becomes meaningless the very moment you
have it. You start searching again.
     The search continues whether you get anything or not. It seems irrelevant—what
you have, what you don't have, the search continues anyway. The poor are searching,
the rich are searching, the ill are searching, the well are searching, the powerful are
searching, the powerless are searching, the stupid are searching, the wise are
searching— and nobody knows exactly what for.
     This very search—what it is and why it is there—has to be understood. It seems
that there is a gap in the human being, in the human mind. In the very structure of the
human consciousness there seems to be a hole, a black hole. You go on throwing
things into it, and they go on disappearing. Nothing seems to make it full, nothing
seems to help toward fulfillment. It is a very feverish search. You seek it in this world,
you seek it in the other world. Sometimes you seek it in money, in power, in prestige,
and sometimes you seek it in God, bliss, love, meditation, prayer—but the search
continues. It seems that man is ill with search.

The search does not allow you to be here and now because the search always leads you somewhere else. The search is a projection, the search is a desire, an idea that somewhere else is what is needed—that it exists, but it exists somewhere else, not here where you are. It certainly exists but not in this moment of time—not now, but somewhere else. It exists then, there, never here now. It goes on nagging you, it goes on pulling you, pushing you. It goes on throwing you into more and more madness; it drives you crazy. And it is never fulfilled.



I have heard about a very great Sufi mystic woman, Rabia al-Adawia:

One evening, as the sun was setting, and there was a little light still left on the road, people found her sitting on the road searching for something. She was an old woman, her eyes were weak, and it was difficult for her to see. So the neighbors came to help her. They asked, "What are you searching for?"

Rabia said, "That question is irrelevant. I am searching— if you can help me, help."

They laughed and said, "Rabia, have you gone mad? You say our question is irrelevant, but if we don't know what you are searching for, how can we help?"

Rabia said, "Okay—just to satisfy you—I am searching for my needle. I have lost my needle." They started helping her but immediately became aware of the fact that the road was very big, and a needle was a very tiny thing.

So they asked Rabia, "Please tell us where you lost it—: the exact, precise place—otherwise it is difficult. The road is big, and we can go on searching and searching forever. Where did you lose it?"

Rabia said, "Again you ask an irrelevant question. How is it concerned with my search?"

They stopped and said, "You have certainly gone crazy!"

Rabia said, "Okay—-just to satisfy you—I have lost it in my house."

They asked, "Then why are you searching here?"

And Rabia is reported to have said, "Because here there is light, and there is no light inside."

This parable is very significant. Have you ever asked yourself what you are searching for? Have you ever made it a point of deep meditation to know what you are searching for? No. Even if in some vague moments, dreaming moments, you have some inkling of what you are searching for, it is never precise, it is never exact.

You have not yet defined it. If you try to define it, the more it becomes defined, the more you will feel that there is no need to search for it. The search can continue only in a state of vagueness, in a state of dreaming; when things are not clear, you simply go on searching, pulled by some inner urge, pushed by some inner urgency. One thing you do know: You need to search. This is an inner need. But you don't know what you are seeking. And unless you know what you are seeking, how can you find it?

It is vague—you think the key is in money, power, prestige, respectability. But then you see people who are respectable, people who are powerful, and they are also seeking. Then you see people who are tremendously rich, and they are also seeking; to the very end of their lives they are seeking. So richness is not going to help, power is not going to help. The search continues in spite of what you have.

The search must be for something else. These names, these labels—money, power, prestige—these are just to satisfy your mind. They are just to help you feel that you are searching for something. That something is still undefined, a very vague feeling.

The first thing for the real seeker—for the seeker who has become a little alert, aware—is" to define the search, to formulate a clear-cut concept of what it is, to bring it out of the dreaming consciousness, to encounter it in deep alertness, to look into it directly; to face it. Immediately a transformation starts happening. If you start defining your search, you will start losing your interest in the search. The more defined it becomes, the less it is there. Once it is clearly known what it is, suddenly it disappears. It exists only when you are not attentive.

Let it be repeated: The search exists only when you are sleepy. The search exists
only when you are not aware; the search exists only in your unawareness. The unawareness creates the search.

Yes, Rabia is right. Inside there is no light—and since there is no light and no consciousness inside, of course you go on searching outside because outside it seems more clear.

Our senses are all extroverted. The eyes open outward, the hands move, spread outward, the legs move into the outside, the ears listen to the outside noises, to sounds. Whatsoever is available to you is all opening to the outside; all the five senses move in an extroverted way. You start searching there—where you see, feel, touch. The light of the senses falls outside, and the seeker is inside.

This dichotomy has to be understood. The seeker is inside—but because the light is outside, the seeker starts moving in an ambitious way, trying to find something outside that will be fulfilling. It is never going to happen. It has never happened. It cannot happen in the nature of things because unless you have sought the seeker, all your search is meaningless. Unless you come to know who you are, all that you seek is futile because you don't know the seeker. Without knowing the seeker, how can you move in the right dimension, in the right direction? It is impossible. The first things should be considered first.

So these two things are very important: First, make it absolutely clear to yourself what your object is. Don't just go on stumbling in darkness. Focus your attention on the object: What are you really searching for? Because sometimes you want one thing, and you go on searching for something else, so even if you succeed you will not be fulfilled. Have you seen people who have succeeded? Can you find bigger failures anywhere else? You have heard the proverb that nothing succeeds like success. It is absolutely wrong. I would like to tell you, nothing fails like success. The proverb must have been invented by stupid people. I repeat: Nothing fails like success.

It is said about Alexander the Great that the day he became the world conqueror, he closed the doors of his room and started weeping. I don't know whether it really happened or not, but if he was even a little intelligent, it must have happened. His generals were very disturbed:

What had happened? They had never seen Alexander weeping. He was not that type of man; he was a great warrior. They had seen him in great difficulties, in situations where life was very much in danger, where death was very imminent, and they had not seen even a tear coming out of his eyes. They had never seen him in any desperate, hopeless moment. What has happened to him now . . . when he has succeeded, when he is the world conqueror?

They knocked on the door, they went in, and they asked, "What has happened to you? Why are you crying like a child?"

He said, "Now that I have succeeded, I know it has been a failure. Now I know that I stand exactly in the same place as I used to be when I started this nonsense of conquering the world. And the point has become clear to me now because there is no other world to conquer; otherwise, I could have remained on the journey, I could have started conquering another world. Now there is no other world to conquer, now there is nothing else to do—and suddenly I am thrown to myself."

A successful man is always thrown to himself in the end, and then he suffers the tortures of hell because he wasted his whole life. He searched and searched, he staked everything that he had. Now he is successful, and his heart is empty, and his soul is meaningless, and there is no fragrance, there is no benediction.

So the first thing is to know exactly what you are seeking. I insist upon it — because the more you focus your eyes on the object of your search, the more the object starts disappearing. When your eyes are absolutely fixed, suddenly there is nothing to seek; immediately your eyes start turning toward yourself When there is no object for search, when all objects have disappeared, there is emptiness. In that emptiness is conversion, turning in. You suddenly start looking at yourself. Now there is nothing to seek, and a new desire arises to know this seeker.

If there is something to seek, you are a worldly man. If there is nothing to seek, and the question "Who is this seeker?" has become important to you, then you are a religious man. This is the way I define the worldly and the religious. If you are still seeking something—maybe in the other life, on the other shore, in heaven, in paradise, it makes no difference—you are still a worldly man. If all seeking has stopped and you have suddenly become aware that now there is only one thing to know—"Who is this seeker in me? What is this energy that wants to seek? Who am I ?—then there is a transformation. All values change suddenly. You start moving inward. Then Rabia is no longer sitting on the road searching for a needle that is lost somewhere in the darkness of her own inner soul.      

Once you have started moving inward . . . In the beginning it is very dark— Rabia is right, it is very, very dark. Because for lives together you have never been inside, your eyes have been focused on the outside world. Have you watched it? Observed? Sometimes when you come in from the road, where it is very sunny and the sun is hot and there is bright light, when you suddenly come into the room or into the house it is very dark—because the eyes are focused for much outside light. When there is much light, the pupils shrink. In darkness the pupils have to relax; a bigger aperture is needed in darkness. In light, a smaller aperture is enough. That's how the camera functions, and that's how your eye functions; the camera has been invented along the lines of the human eye.

So when you suddenly come in from the outside, your own house looks dark. But if you sit a little while, by and by the darkness disappears. There is more light; your eyes are settling. For many lives together you have been outside in the hot sun, in the world, so when you go in you have completely forgotten how to enter and how to readjust your eyes. Meditation is nothing but a readjustment of your vision, a readjustment of your seeing faculty, of your eyes.

In India that is what is called your third eye. It is not an actual eye somewhere, it is a readjustment, a total readjustment of your vision. By and by the darkness is no longer dark. A subtle, suffused light starts being felt. And if you go on looking inside—it takes time—gradually, slowly, you start feeling a beautiful light inside. It is not aggressive light like the sun; it is more like the moon. It is not glaring, it is not dazzling, it is very cool. It is not hot, it is very compassionate, it is very soothing, it is a balm.      

By and by, when you have adjusted to the inside light, you will see that you are the very source. The seeker is the sought. Then you will see that the treasure is within you, and the whole problem was that you were seeking for it outside. You were seeking it somewhere outside, and it has always been there inside you. It has always been here within you. You were seeking in a wrong direction, that's all.

Everything is available to you as much as it is available to anyone else, as much as it is available to a Buddha, to a Baal-Shem, to a Moses, to a Muhammad. It is all available to you, only you are looking in the wrong direction. As far as the treasure is concerned, you are not poorer than Buddha or Muhammad—no, God has never created a poor man. It does not happen—it cannot happen because God creates you out of his richness. How can God create a poor man? You are his overflowing; you are part of existence. How can you be poor? You are rich, infinitely rich—as rich as nature itself.

But you are looking in the wrong direction. The direction is wrong. That's why you go on missing. And it is not that you will not succeed in life—you can succeed. But still you will be a failure. Nothing is going to satisfy you because nothing can be attained in the outside world that can be comparable to the inner treasure, to the inner light, to the inner bliss.




SELF-KNOWLEDGE IS POSSIBLE ONLY IN DEEP ALONENESS. Ordinarily whatever we
know about ourselves is the opinion of others. They say, "You are good," and we think
we are good. They say, "You are beautiful," and we think we are beautiful. They say,.
"You are bad" or "You are ugly" . . . whatsoever people say about us, we go on col-
lecting. That becomes our self-identity. It is utterly false because nobody else can know
you—nobody can know who you are except you, yourself. They know only aspects,
and those aspects are very superficial. They know only momentary moods; they cannot
penetrate your center. Not even your lover can penetrate to the very core of your being. There you are utterly alone, and only there will you come to know who you are.

People live their whole lives believing in what others say, dependent on others.
                                That's why people are very afraid of others' opinions.
                                If they think you are bad, you become bad. If they
                                condemn you, you start condemning yourself. If they
                                say that you are a sinner, you start feeling guilty.
                                Because you have to depend on their opinions, you
                                have to continuously conform to their ideas; otherwise
                                they will change their opinions. This creates a slavery,
                                a very subtle slavery. If you want to be known as
                                good, worthy, beautiful, intelligent, then you have to
                                concede, you have to compromise continuously with
                                people on whom you are dependent.
                                     And another problem arises. Because there are so
                                many people, they go on feeding your mind with
                                different types of opinions—conflicting opinions, too.
                                One opinion contradicting another opinion; hence a
                                great confusion exists inside you. One person says you
                                are very intelligent, another person says you are
                                stupid. How to decide? So you are divided. You
                                become suspicious about yourself, about who you are
... a wavering. And the complexity is very great because there are thousands of people
around you.

You come in contact with so many people, and everybody is feeding his idea into your mind. And nobody knows you—not even you yourself know—so
all this collection becomes jumbled up inside. This is a maddening situation. You have
many voices inside you. Whenever you ask who you are, many answers will come.
Some answers will be your mother's, some will be your father's, some will be your
teacher's, and so on and so forth. And it is impossible to decide which one is the right
answer. How to decide? What is the criterion? This is where man is lost. This is self-
ignorance.

But because you depend on others, you are afraid to go into alone-ness—because the moment you start going into aloneness, you start becoming very afraid of losing yourself. You don't have yourself in the first place, but whatever self you have created out of others' opinions will have to be left behind. Hence, it is very scary to go in. The deeper you go, the less you know who you are. So in fact when you are moving toward self-knowledge, before it happens you will have to drop all ideas about the self. There will be a gap; there will be a kind of nothingness. You will become a nonentity. You will be utterly lost because all that you know is no longer relevant, and that which is relevant you don't know yet.

Christian mystics call this "the dark night of the soul." It has to be passed, and once you have passed it, there is the dawn. The sun rises, and one comes to know oneself for the first time. The first ray of the sun, and all is fulfilled. The first songs of the birds in the morning, and all is attained.



BE AUTHENTIC

Truthfulness means authenticity—to be true, not to be false, not to use masks. Whatsoever is your real face, show it at whatever the cost.

Remember, that doesn't mean that you have to unmask others; if they are happy with their lies, it is for them to decide. Don't go and unmask anybody because this is how people think—they say they have to be truthful, authentic; they mean they have to go and make everybody nude because "Why are you hiding your body? These clothes are not needed." No. Please remember: Be truthful to yourself. You are not needed to reform anybody else in the world. If you can grow yourself, that's enough. Don't be a reformer, and don't try to teach others, and don't try to change others. If you change, that's enough of a message.

To be authentic means to remain true to your own being. How to remain true? Three things have to be remembered. One, never listen to anybody, what they tell you to be. Always listen to your inner voice, what you would like to be; otherwise your whole life will be wasted. Your mother wants you to be an engineer, your father wants you to be a doctor, and you want to be a poet. What to do? Of course the mother is right because it is more economical, more financially helpful, to be an engineer. The father is also right; to be a doctor is a good commodity in the market, it has a market value. A poet? Have you gone mad? Are you crazy? Poets are people who are cursed. Nobody wants them. There is no need for them; the world can exist without poetry— there will be no trouble just because there is no poetry. The world cannot exist without engineers; the world needs engineers. If you are needed, you are valuable. If you are not needed, you don't carry any value.

But if you want to be a poet, be a poet. You may be a beggar— good. You may not become very rich out of it, but don't worry about it. Because otherwise you may become a great engineer, and you may earn much money, but you will never have any fulfillment. You will always hanker; your inner being will hanker to be a poet.

I have heard that one great scientist, a surgeon who was awarded a Nobel Prize,
was asked, "When the Nobel Prize was awarded to you,
you didn't look very happy. What is the matter?" He said,
"I always wanted to be a dancer. I never wanted to be a
surgeon in the first place, and now not only have I
become a surgeon, I have become a very successful
surgeon, and this is a burden. I wanted to be just a
dancer, and I remain a lousy dancer— that is my pain,
my anguish. Whenever I see somebody dancing, I feel so
miserable, in such hell. What will I do with this Nobel
Prize? It can't become a dance to me; it can't give me a
dance."

Remember, be true to your inner voice. It may lead you into danger; then go in danger, but remain true to the inner voice. Then there is a possibility that one day you will come to a state where you can dance with inner fulfillment.

Always look: The first thing is your being. Don't allow others to manipulate and control you—and they are many; everybody is ready to control you, everybody is ready to change you, everybody is ready to give you a direction you have not asked for. Everybody is giving you a guide for your life. The guide exists within you, you carry the blueprint.

To be authentic means to be true to oneself. It is a very, very dangerous phenomenon; rare people can do that. But whenever people do it, they achieve. They achieve such beauty, such grace, such contentment that you cannot imagine.

The reason everybody looks so frustrated is that nobody has listened to his own voice. You wanted to marry a girl, but the girl was a Mohammedan, and you are a Hindu Brahmin, your parents wouldn't allow it. The society wouldn't accept it, it was dangerous. The girl was poor and you are rich. So you married a rich woman, Hindu, Brahmin by caste, accepted by everybody but not by your heart. So now you live an ugly life. Now you go to prostitutes—but even pros- titutes won't help you; you have prostituted your whole life. You wasted your whole life.

Always listen to the inner voice, and don't listen to anything else.

There are a thousand and one temptations around you because many people are peddling their things. It is a supermarket, the world, and everybody in it is interested in selling his thing to you. Everybody is a salesman. If you listen to too many salesmen, you will become mad. Don't listen to anybody Just close your eyes and listen to the inner voice. That is what meditation is all about, to listen to the inner voice. This is the first thing.

Then the second thing—only if you have done the first thing does the second become possible—never wear a mask. If you are angry, be angry. It is risky, but don't smile because that is being untrue. You have been taught that when you are angry, smile, but then your smile becomes false, a mask—-just an exercise of the lips and nothing else. The heart full of anger, poison, and the lips smiling; you become a false phenomenon.

Then the other thing also happens: When you want to smile, you cannot smile. Your whole mechanism is topsyturvy because when you wanted to be angry you weren't; when you wanted to hate you didn't. Now you want to love; suddenly you find that the mechanism doesn't function. Now you want to smile; you have to force it. Really, your heart is full of smile, and you want to laugh out loud, but you cannot laugh. Something chokes in the heart, something chokes in the throat. The smile doesn't come, or even if it comes, it is a very pale and dead smile. It doesn't make you happy, you don't bubble up with it. It is not a radiance around you.

When you want to be angry, be angry. Nothing is wrong in being angry. If you want to laugh, laugh. Nothing is wrong in laughing loudly. By and by you will see that your whole system is functioning. When it functions, really, it has a hum around it. Just like a car hums when everything is going well—the driver who loves the car knows that now everything is functioning well. There is an organic unity; the mechanism is functioning well.

You can see it—whenever a person's mechanism is functioning well you can sense the hum around him. He walks, but his step has a dance in it. He talks, but his words carry a subtle poetry in them. He looks at you, and he really looks; it is not just lukewarm, it is really warm. When he touches you, he really touches you; you can feel his energy moving into your body, a current of life being transferred . . . because his mechanism is functioning well.

Don't wear masks; otherwise you will create dysfunctions, blocks in your mechanism. There are many blocks in your body. A person who has been suppressing anger—his jaw becomes blocked. All the anger comes up to the jaw and then stops there. His hands become ugly; they don't have the graceful movement of a dancer, no, because the anger comes into the fingers and becomes blocked. Remember, anger has two outlets for release: one is the teeth, another is the fingers. All animals when they are angry will bite you with the teeth or they will start tearing you with the hands. So the nails and the teeth are the two points from where the anger is released.

I have a suspicion that wherever anger is suppressed too much, people have teeth trouble. Their teeth go wrong because too much energy is there and never released. And anybody who suppresses anger will eat more—angry people will always eat more because the teeth need some exercise. Angry people will smoke more. Angry people will talk more—they can become obsessive talkers because somehow the jaw needs exercise so that the energy is released a little bit. And angry people's hands will become knotted, ugly. If the energy had been released, they could have become beautiful hands.

If you suppress anything, there is some corresponding part in the body to the emotion. If you don't want to cry, your eyes will lose their luster because tears are needed; they are a very alive phenomenon. When once in a while you weep and cry— really you go into it, you become it, and tears start flowing from your eyes—your eyes are cleansed, your eyes become fresh again, young and virgin.

That's why women have more beautiful eyes—because they can still cry. Men have lost the beauty of their eyes because they have a wrong notion that men should not cry. If a small boy cries, even the parents say, "What are you doing? Are you being a sissy?" What nonsense! Because God has given you—man and woman—the same tear glands. If man were not meant to weep, there would have been no tear glands. Simple mathematics. Why do the tear glands exist in men in the same proportion as they exist in women? Eyes need weeping and crying, and it is really beautiful if you can cry and weep wholeheartedly.

Remember, if you cannot cry and weep wholeheartedly, you cannot laugh, either, because that is the other polarity. People who can laugh can also cry; people who cannot cry cannot laugh. And you may have observed it sometimes in children: if they laugh loudly and long, they start crying—because both things are joined. In the villages I have heard mothers saying to their children, "Don't laugh too much; otherwise you will start crying." Really true be- cause the phenomena are not different, just the same energy moves to the opposite poles. So the second thing: Don't use masks—be true whatsoever the cost.

And the third thing about authenticity: Always remain in the present because all falseness enters either from the past or from the future. That which has passed has passed. Don't bother about it and don't carry it as a burden; otherwise, it will not allow you to be authentic to the present. And all that has not come has not come yet. Don't unnecessarily be bothered about the future, otherwise that will come into the present and destroy it. Be true to the present, and then you will be authentic. To be here now is to be authentic. No past, no future— this moment, all. This moment the whole eternity.

These three things, and you attain truthfulness. Then whatsoever you say will be true. Ordinarily you think you have to be careful to say the truth; I'm not saying that. I am saying create authenticity, and whatsoever you say will be true.


TRUTH IS NOT SOMETHING LOGICAL. By truth I don't mean a conclusion arrived at by logical, rational methods. By truth I mean the authenticity of being, not imposing anything that you are not, just being that which you are at whatsoever the risk, never becoming a hypocrite. If you are sad, you are sad. That is the truth in that moment; don't hide it. Don't put a false smile on your face because that false smile will create a split in you. You will become two—a part of you will be smiling, and of course it is only going to be a minor part, and the major part will remain sad. Now a division has arisen, and if you go on doing it again and again . . .

When you are angry, you don't show your anger—you are afraid it may destroy your image because people think you are so compassionate, and people say that you are never angry. They appreciate it, and it is so gratifying to the ego. Now, being angry will destroy your beautiful image, so rather than destroying the image, you repress the anger. It is boiling within, but on the surface you remain compassionate, kind, polite, sweet. Now the division is being practiced. People are practicing it through their whole lives; then the division becomes absolutely settled. Even when you are sitting alone and there is nobody, and there is no need to pretend, you go on pretending; it has become second nature. People are not true even in their bathrooms; even when they are utterly alone, they are untrue. Now it is not a question of being true or untrue; it has just become their habit. For the whole of their lives they have practiced, and as you practice more and more, the distance between the two parts of you becomes bigger and bigger.

When it becomes unbridgeable, we call it
schizophrenia. When you cannot contact your own
other part, you almost become two persons instead
of one; then it is severe mental illness. But
everybody is divided, so the difference between the
schizophrenic and the normal is only of degree. It is
not very basic, not of quality but only of quantity.

By truth I mean not to pretend. Just be whatsoever you are—one moment you are sad, so that moment you are sad. And next moment if you become happy, there is no need now to continue to remain sad—because that, too, has been taught: to always be consistent, to remain consistent. It happens, you can observe it—you were sad, and then suddenly sadness is gone, but you cannot laugh immediately because what will people think? Are you mad? Just before you were sad; now you immediately start laughing? Only mad people or small children do this; it is not expected of you. You will have to wait for a certain situation in which slowly, slowly you can relax and start smiling and laughing again.

So it is not only that when you are sad you pretend smiles; when you want to smile then, too, you pretend sadness because of that whole stupid idea of remaining consistent. Each moment has its own way, and no moment needs to be consistent with any other moment. Life is a flux, it is a river: It goes on changing its moods. So one need not be worried about consistency. Anybody who becomes worried about consistency will become untrue because only lies can be consistent. Truth is always changing. Truth contains its own contradictions—and that's the richness of truth, that's its vastness, that's its beauty.

So if you are feeling sad, then be sad—with no condemnation, with no evaluation of it being good or bad. There is no question of good or bad, it is simply so. And when it goes, let it go. When again you start smiling, don't feel guilty because just now you were sad, so how can you smile? Let somebody first tell a joke, let somebody first break the ice, and then you will smile. Wait for the right moment. That is again hypocrisy. When you are happy, be happy; there is no need to pretend anything.

And remember: Each moment has an atomic reality. It is discontinuous from the past moment and it is not connected with the future moment. Each moment is atomic. They are not following each other in a sequence, they are not linear. Each moment has its own way of being, and you have to be that, in that moment, nothing else. This is what is really meant by truth.

Truth means authenticity, truth means sincerity. Truth is not a logical thing. It is a psychological state of being true—not true according to some ideal, because if there is some ideal you will become false. If you think that to be like a Buddha is to be true, then you will never be true because you are not a Buddha, and you will impose the Buddha on you. You can sit like the Buddha, you can almost become a marble statue, but deep down you will still be the same. The Buddha will be just a posture. And if you have an ideal, you cannot be true to the moment because the ideal is always there and you have to imitate the ideal.

The true man has no ideals. He lives moment to moment; he always lives as he feels in the moment. He is utterly respectful toward his feelings, his emotions, his moods. And this is what I want people to be: authentic, true, sincere, respectful toward their own soul.


LISTEN TO YOURSELF

Always listen to your own feelings, there is no need to look
around. And by looking at people, you cannot see exactly
what is happening to them because their face is not their
reality, just as your face is not your reality. Their outside
appearance is not their inner, just as your outside
appearance is not your inner.
     That is the whole hypocrisy of society—not to show
your inner, your center, your real face. Hide it. Show it
only to someone who is very intimate and who will
understand. But who is intimate? Even lovers don't show
their faces to each other. Because nobody knows; this
minute somebody is a lover, next minute maybe not. So each becomes like an island, closed.
     Don't look at others, look at yourself. And let what is inside of you come out,
whatsoever the risk. There is no greater risk than suppression. If you suppress, you will lose
all zest for life, all enthusiasm. You will lose all life if you go on suppressing. It is toxic; it
poisons the being.

Listen to the heart, and whatsoever is there, bring it out. Soon you will become efficient in bringing it out, and you will enjoy it. And once you know how to be true, it is so beautiful that you will never settle for being false. We go on deciding to be false because we have never tasted the real. From the very beginning of childhood the real was suppressed. Before a child becomes aware of what is real, he has been taught to suppress it. In unconscious ways, mechanical ways, he goes on suppressing without knowing what he is doing.

Be true to yourself—there is no other responsibility. One has to be responsible toward one's being. You are answerable to your own being, and God is not going to ask you why you were not somebody else.

There is a story that when the Hasid mystic Josiah was dying, somebody asked him
why wasn't he praying to God, and was he sure that Moses would be a witness to him. He
replied, "Let me tell you one thing. God is not going to ask me why I am not a Moses. He
will ask me why I am not a Josiah."

This is the whole problem, how to be oneself. And if you can solve this, then every other problem becomes nonproblematic. Then life is a beautiful mystery to be lived—not a problem to be solved but just to be lived and enjoyed.


TRUST YOURSELF

Trust is possible only if first you trust in yourself. The most fundamental thing has to happen within you first. If you trust in yourself, you can trust in me, you can trust in people, you can trust in existence. But if you don't trust in yourself, then no other trust is ever possible.

And society destroys trust at the very roots. It does not allow you to trust yourself. It teaches all other kinds of trust—trust in the parents, trust in the church, trust in the state, trust in God, ad infinitum—but the basic trust is completely destroyed. And then all other trusts are phony, are bound to be phony. Then all other trusts are just plastic flowers. You don't have real roots for real flowers to grow.

Society does it deliberately, on purpose, because a man who trusts in himself is dangerous for society—a society that depends on slavery, a society that has invested too much in slavery. A man trusting himself is an independent man. You cannot make predictions about him, he will move in his own way. Freedom will be his life. He will trust when he feels, when he loves, and then his trust will have a tremendous intensity and truth in it. Then his trust will be alive and authentic. And he will be ready to risk all for his trust— but only when he feels it, only when it is true, only when it stirs his heart, only when it stirs his intelligence and his love. Otherwise not. You cannot force him into any kind of believing.

This society depends on belief. Its whole structure is that of auto- hypnosis. Its whole structure is based in creating robots and machines, not men. It needs dependent people—so much so that they are constantly in need of being tyrannized, so much so that they are searching and seeking their own tyrants, their own Adolf Hitlers, their own Mus-solinis, their own Josef Stalins and Mao Ze- dongs. This earth, this beautiful earth, we have turned into a great prison. A few power-lusty people have reduced the whole of humanity into a mob. Man is allowed to exist only if he compromises with all kinds of nonsense.

Now, to tell a child to believe in God is nonsense, utter nonsense—not that God does not exist, but because the child has not yet felt the thirst, the desire, the longing. He is not yet ready to go in search of the truth, the ultimate truth of life. He is not yet mature enough to inquire into the reality of existence. That love affair has to happen someday, but it can happen only if no belief is imposed upon him. If he is converted before the thirst has arisen to explore and to know, then his whole life he will live in a phony way; he will live in a pseudo way.

Yes, he will talk about God because he has been told that God is. He has been told
authoritatively, and he has been told by people who were very powerful in his childhood—
his parents, his priests, his teachers. He has been told by people, and he had to accept it; it
was a question of his survival. He could not say no to his parents because without them he would
not be able to live at all. It was too risky to say no; he had to say yes. But his yes can't be
true.
        How can it be true? He is saying yes only as a political device, to survive. You have not
turned him into a religious person, you have made him a diplomat, you have created a
politician. You have sabotaged his potential to grow into an authentic being. You have
poisoned him. You have destroyed the very possibility of his intelligence because
intelligence arises only when the longing arises to know. Now the longing will never arise
because before the question has taken possession of his soul, the answer has already been
supplied. Before he was hungry, the food has been forced
into his being. Now, without hunger, this forced food
cannot be digested; there is no hunger to digest it. That's
why people live like pipes through which life passes like
undigested food.

One has to be very patient with children, very alert, very conscious not to say anything that may hinder their own intelligence from arriving, not to convert them into Christians, Hindus, and Muhammadans. One needs infinite patience. One day that miracle happens, when the child himself starts inquiring. Then, too, don't supply him with ready-made answers. Ready-made answers help nobody; ready-made answers are dull and stupid. Help him to become more intelligent Rather than giving him answers, give him situations and challenges so that his intelligence is sharpened and he asks more deeply—so that the question penetrates to his very core, so that the question becomes a question of life and death.

But that is not allowed. Parents are very much afraid, society is very much afraid. If children are allowed to remain free, who knows? They may never come to the fold the parents belonged to, they may never go to the church—Catholic, Protestant, this or that. Who knows what is going to happen when they become intelligent on their own? They will not be within your control. And this society goes into deeper and deeper politics to control everybody, to possess everybody's soul.

That's why the first thing they have to do is to destroy trust—the trust of the child in himself, the confidence of the child in himself. They have to make him shaky and afraid. Once he is trembling, he is controllable. If he is confident, he is uncontrollable. If he is confident he will assert himself, he will try to do his own thing. He will never want to do anybody else's thing. He will go on his own journey, he will not fulfill somebody else's desires for some trip. He will never be an imitator, he will never be a dull and dead person. He will be so alive, so pulsating with life, that nobody will be able to control him.

Destroy his trust, and you have castrated him. You have taken his power; now he will always be powerless and always in need of somebody to dominate, direct, and command him. Now he will be a good soldier, a good citizen, a good nationalist, a good Christian, a good Mohammedan, a good Hindu.

     Yes, he will be all these things. But he will not be a real individual. He will not have
any roots, he will be uprooted his whole life. He will live without roots—and to live without
roots is to live in misery, is to live in hell. Just as trees need roots in the earth, man is also a tree and needs roots in existence or else he will live a very unintelligent life.

Just the other day, I was reading a story:

Three surgeons, old friends, met on holiday. On the beach, sitting under the sun,
they started boasting. The first said, "I came across a man who had lost both of his
legs in the war. I gave him artificial legs, and it has been a miracle. Now he has
become one of the greatest runners in the world! There is every possibility that in
the coming Olympics, he will win."
      The other said, "That's nothing. I came across a woman who fell from a
thirty-story building. Her face was completely crushed. I did a great job of plastic
surgery. Just the other day I came to know through the newspapers that she has
become the world beauty queen."
     The third was a humble man. The others looked at him and asked, "What
have you done lately? What's new?"
     The man said, "Nothing much—and moreover, I am not allowed to say
anything about it."
     His colleagues became more curious. They said, "But we are friends, we can
keep your secret. You need not be worried; it won't leak out."
     So he said, "Okay, if you say so, if you promise: A man was brought to me, he
had lost his head in a car accident. I was at a loss to know what to do. I rushed into
my garden just to think what to do, and suddenly 1 came across a cabbage. Finding
nothing else, I transplanted the cabbage in place of the head. And do you know
what? That man has become the president of the United States."

You can destroy the child; still, he can become the president of the United States. There is no inherent impossibility of becoming successful without intelligence. In fact, it is more difficult to become successful with intelligence because the intelligent person is inventive. He is always ahead of his time; it takes time to understand him.

The unintelligent person is easily understood. He fits with the gestalt of society; the society has values and criteria by which to judge him. But it takes years for society to evaluate a genius.

I am not saying that a person who has no intelligence cannot become successful, cannot become famous—but he will still remain phony. And that is the misery: You can become famous, but if you are phony, you live in misery. You don't know what blessings life is showering on you— you will never know. You don't have enough intelligence to know. You will never see the beauty of existence because you don't have the sensitivity to know it. You will never see the sheer miracle that surrounds you, that crosses your path in millions of ways every day. You will never see it because to see it, you need a tremendous capacity to understand, to feel, to be.

This society is a power-oriented society. This society is still utterly primitive, utterly
barbarian. A few people—politicians, priests, professors—are dominating millions. And this
society is run in such a way that no child is allowed to have intelligence. It is a sheer accident
that once in a while a Buddha arrives on the earth—a
sheer accident. Somehow, once in a while a
person escapes from the clutches of society.
Once in a while a person remains unpoisoned by
society. That must be because of some error,
some mistake of society. Otherwise society
succeeds in destroying your roots, in destroying
your trust in yourself. And once that is done, you
will never be able to trust anybody. Once you are
incapable of loving yourself, you will never be
able to love anybody. That is an absolute truth,
there are no exceptions to it. You can love others
only if you are able to love yourself. But society
condemns self-love. It says it is selfishness, it
says it is narcissistic.

Yes, self-love can become narcissistic, but it is not necessarily so. It can become narcissistic if it never moves beyond itself, it can become a kind of selfishness if it becomes confined to oneself. Otherwise, self-love is the beginning of all other loves.

A person who loves himself sooner or later starts overflowing with love. A person who trusts himself cannot distrust anybody, even those who are going to deceive him, even those who have already deceived him. Yes, he cannot even distrust them because now he knows trust is far more valuable than anything else.

You can cheat a person—but of what can you cheat him? You can take some money or something else from him. But the man who knows the beauty of trust will not be distracted by these small things. He will still love you, he will still trust you. And then a miracle happens: If a person really trusts you, it is impossible to cheat him, almost impossible.

It happens every day in your life, too. Whenever you trust somebody, it becomes impossible for him to cheat you, to deceive you. Sitting on the platform in a railway station, you don't know the person who is sitting by your side—he is a stranger, a complete stranger—and you say to him, "Please just watch my luggage. I have to go to purchase a ticket." And you go. You trust an absolute stranger. But it almost never happens that the stranger deceives you. He could have deceived you if you had not trusted him.

Trust has a magic in it. How can he deceive you now that you have trusted him? How can he fall so low? He will never be able to forgive himself if he deceives you.

There is an intrinsic quality in human consciousness to trust and to be trusted. Everybody enjoys being trusted. It is respect from the other person—and when you trust a stranger it is more so. There is no reason to trust him, and still you trust him. You raise the man to such a high pedestal, you value the man so much, it is almost impossible for him to fall from that height. And if he falls, he will never be able to forgive himself, he will have to carry the weight of guilt his whole life.

A man who trusts himself comes to know the beauty of it—comes to know that the more you trust yourself, the more you bloom; the more you are in a state of let-go and relaxation, the more you are settled and serene, the more you are calm, cool, and quiet. And it is so beautiful that you start trusting more and more people because the more you trust, the more your calmness deepens; your coolness goes deeper and deeper to the very core of your being. And the more you trust, the more you soar high. A man who can trust will sooner or later know the logic of trust. And then one day he is bound to try to trust the unknown.

Start trusting yourself—that is the fundamental lesson, the first lesson. Start loving yourself. If you don't love yourself, who else is going to love you? But remember, if you only love yourself, your love will be very poor.

A great Jewish mystic, Hillel, has said, "If you are not for yourself, who is going to be for you?" And also, "If you are only for yourself, then what meaning can your life ever have?"—a tremendously significant statement. Remember it: Love yourself because if you don't love yourself, nobody else will ever be able to love you.

You cannot love a person who hates himself. And on this unfortunate earth, almost everybody hates himself, everybody condemns himself. How can you love a person who is condemnatory toward himself? He will not believe you. He cannot love himself—how can you dare? He cannot love himself—how can you love him? He will suspect some game, some trick, some trip. He will suspect that you are trying to deceive him in the name of love. He will be very cautious, alert, and his suspicion will poison your being. If you love a person who hates himself, you are trying to destroy his concept about himself. And nobody easily drops his concept about himself; that is his identity. He will fight with you, he will prove to you that he is right and you are wrong.

That's what is happening in every love relationship—
let me call it every so-called love relationship. It is
happening between every husband and wife, every lover
and beloved, every man and every woman. How can you
destroy the other's concept about himself? That is his
identity, that is his ego, that's how he knows himself. If you
take it away, he will not know who he is. It is too risky; he
cannot drop his concept so easily. He will prove to you that
he is not worth loving; he is only worth hating. And the
same is the case with you. You also hate yourself; you
cannot allow anybody else to love you. Whenever somebody comes with loving energy
around you, you shrink, you want to escape, you are afraid. You know perfectly well that you
are unworthy of love, you know that only on the surface do you look so good, so beautiful;
deep down you are ugly. And if you allow this person to love you, sooner or later—and it
will be sooner rather than later—he will come to know who you are in reality. How long will
you be able to pretend with a person with whom you have to live in love? You can pretend in
the marketplace, you can pretend in the Lions Club and the Rotary Club—smiles, all smiles.
You can do beautiful acting and role-playing. But if you live with a woman or a man for
twenty-four hours a day, then it is tiring to go on smiling and smiling and smiling. Then the
smile tires you because it is phony. It is just an exercise of the lips, and the lips become tired.

How can you go on being sweet? Your bitterness will surface. Hence, by the time the honeymoon is over, everything is over. Both have known each other's reality, both have known each other's phoniness, both have known each other's falsity.
                                   
One is afraid to become intimate. To be intimate means you will have to put aside the role. And you know who you are: worthless, just dirt; that's what you have been told from the very beginning. Your parents, your teachers, your priests, your politicians—all have been telling you that you are dirt, worthless. Nobody has ever accepted you. Nobody has given you the feeling that you are loved and respected, that you are needed—that this existence will miss you, that without you this existence will not be the same, that without you there will be a hole. Without you this universe will lose some poetry, some beauty: A song will be missed, a note will be missed, there will be a gap—nobody has told you that.

And that's what my work here is: to destroy the distrust that has been created in you about yourself, to destroy all condemnation that has been imposed on you, to take it away from you and to give you a feeling that you are loved and respected, loved by existence. God has created you because he loved you. He loved you so much that he could not resist the temptation to create you.

when a painter paints, he paints because he loves. Vincent van Gogh continually
painted the sun his whole life, he loved the sun so much. In fact, it was the sun that drove him mad. For one year continuously he was standing
and painting under the hot sun. His whole life revolved around the sun. And the day he was
contented, painting the painting that he had always wanted to paint—and to paint this
painting he had painted many others, but he had not been contented with them—the day he
was contented, the day he could say, "Yes, this is the thing that I wanted to paint," he
committed suicide because, he . said, "My work is done. I have done the thing that I came
for. My destiny is fulfilled, now it is pointless to live."
        His whole life a devotion to a certain painting? He must have been madly in love
  with the sun. He looked at the sun so long that it destroyed his eyes, his vision, it drove
  him mad.

When a poet composes a song, it is because he loves it. God has painted you, sung you, danced you. God loves you! If you don't see any meaning in the word God, don't be worried. Call it existence, call it the whole. The  existence loves you, otherwise you would not be here.

Relax into your being, you are cherished by the whole. That's why the whole goes on breathing in you, pulsating in you. Once you start feeling this tremendous respect and love and trust of the whole in you, you will start growing roots into your being. You will trust yourself. And only then can you trust me, only then can you trust your friends, your children, your husband, your wife. Only then can you trust the trees and the animals and the stars and the moon. Then one simply lives as trust. It is no more a question of trusting this or that; one simply trusts. And to trust is simply to be religious.

That's what sannyas is all about. Sannyas is to undo all that society has done. It is not just accidental that priests are against me, politicians are against me, parents are against me, the whole establishment is against me; it is not accidental. I can understand the absolutely clear logic of it. I am trying to undo what they have done. I am sabotaging the whole pattern of this slave society.

My effort is to create rebels, and the beginning of the rebel is to trust in oneself. If I can help you to trust in yourself, I have helped you. Nothing else is needed; everything else follows of its own accord.
