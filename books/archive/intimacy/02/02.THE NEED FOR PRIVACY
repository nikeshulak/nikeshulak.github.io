THE NEED FOR PRIVACY

The being has two sides, the without and the within. The without can be public, but the within cannot be. If you make the within public, you will lose your soul, you will lose your original face. Then you will live as if you have no inner being. Life will become drab, futile.

It happens to people who lead a public life—politicians, film actors. They become public,
they lose their inner being completely; they don't know who they are except what the public
says about them. They depend on others' opinions; they don't have a sense of their being.
     One of the most famous actresses, Marilyn Monroe, committed suicide, and
psychoanalysts have been brooding on the reason why. She was one of the most beautiful
women ever, one of the most successful. Even the president of the United States, John F.
Kennedy, was in love with her, and millions of people loved her. One cannot think of what
more you can have. She had everything.
     But she was public and she knew it. Even in her love chamber when President Kennedy
would be there, she addressed him as "Mr. President"—as if one was making love not to a
man but to an institution.
     She was an institution. By and by she became aware that she had nothing private. Once
she had just posed for a nude calendar, and somebody asked, "Did you have anything on
while you posed for the calendar?"
     She replied, "Yes, I had something on—the radio."
     Exposed, nude, no private self. My feeling is that she committed suicide because that
was the only thing left she could have done privately. Everything was public; that was the
only thing left she could do on her own, alone, something absolutely intimate and
                                    secret. Public figures are always tempted toward suicide
                                    because only through suicide can they have a glimpse of
                                    who they are.

All that is beautiful is inner, and the inner means privacy. Have you watched women making love? They always close their eyes. They know something. A man goes on making love with open eyes; he remains a watcher. He is not completely in the act; he is not totally in it. He remains a voyeur, as if somebody else is making love and he is watching, as if the lovemaking is on a TV screen or in a movie. But a woman knows better because she is more delicately tuned to the inner. She always closes her eyes. Then love has a totally different fragrance.

Do one thing: At night run the bath, and then switch on and off the light. When there is darkness you will hear the water falling more clearly, the sound will be sharp. When the light is on, the sound will be not so sharp. What happens in darkness? In darkness, because you cannot see, everything else disappears. Only you and the sound are there. That's why in all good restaurants sharp light is avoided. They are candlelit. Whenever a restaurant is candlelit, taste is deeper—you eat well and you taste more. The fragrance surrounds you. If there is very bright light, the taste is no longer there. The eyes make everything public.

In the very first sentence of his Metaphysics, Aristotle says that sight is the highest sense of man. It is not—in fact, sight has become too domineering. It has
monopolized the whole self and destroyed all the other senses. Aristotle's master, Plato, says
that there is a hierarchy in the senses—sight at the top, touch at the bottom. He is absolutely
wrong. There is no hierarchy All senses are on the same level, and there should not be any
hierarchy.

But you live through the eyes: Eighty percent of your life is eye oriented. This should not be so; a balance has to be restored. You should also touch, because touch has something that eyes cannot give. But try, try to touch the woman you love or the man you love in bright light, and then touch in darkness. In darkness the body reveals itself; in bright light it hides.

Have you seen Renoir's paintings of feminine
bodies? They have something miraculous in them.
Many painters have painted the feminine body, but
there is no comparison with Renoir. What is the
difference? All other painters have painted the
feminine body as it looks to the eyes. Renoir has
painted it as it feels to the hands, so the paintings
have a warmth and a closeness, an aliveness.

When you touch, something happens very close. When you see, something is far away. In darkness, in secrecy, in privacy, something is revealed that cannot be revealed in openness, in the marketplace. Others are seeing and observing; something deep within you shrinks, it cannot flower. It is just as if you put seeds down on the open ground for everybody to look at. They will never sprout. They need to be thrown deep in the womb of the earth, in deep darkness where nobody can see them. There they start sprouting, and a great tree is born.

Just as seeds need darkness and privacy in the earth, all relationships that are deep and intimate remain inner. They need privacy, they need a place where only two exist. Then a moment comes when even the two dissolve, and only one exists.

Two lovers deeply in tune with each other dissolve. Only one exists. They breathe together, they are together; a togetherness exists. This would not be possible if observers were there. They would never be able to let go if others were watching. The very eyes of others would become the barrier. So all that is beautiful, all that is deep, happens in darkness. In human relationships, privacy is needed. Secrecy has its own reason to be there. Remember that, and always remember that you will behave very foolishly in life if you become completely public. It will be as if somebody has turned his pockets inside out. That will be your shape, like pockets turned inside out. Nothing is wrong in being outward, but remember, that is only part of life. It should not become the whole.

I am not saying to move in darkness forever. Light has its own beauty and its own reason. If the seed remains in the dark forever and ever, and never comes up to receive the sun in the morning, it will be dead. It has to go into darkness to sprout, to gather strength, to become vital, to be reborn; and then it has to come out and face the world and the light and the storm and the rains. It has to accept the challenge of the outside. But that challenge can only be accepted if you are deeply rooted within.

I am not saying to become escapists. I am not saying to close your eyes, move within and never come out. I am simply saying go in so that you can come out with energy, with love, with compassion. Go in so that when you come out you are not a beggar but a king. Go in so that when you come out you have something to share—the flowers, the leaves. Go in so that your coming out becomes richer and is not impoverished. And always remember whenever you feel exhausted that the source of energy is within. Close your eyes and go in.

Make outer relationships, and make inner relationships also. Of course there are bound to be outer relationships—you move in the world, business relationships will be there—but they should not be all. They have their part to play, but there must be something absolutely secret and private, something that you can call your own.

That is what Marilyn Monroe lacked. She was a public woman, successful, yet completely a failure. While she was at the top of her success and fame, she committed suicide. Why she committed suicide has remained an enigma. She had everything to live for; you cannot conceive of more fame, more success, more charisma, more beauty, more health. Everything was there, nothing could be improved upon, and still something was lacking. The inside, the within, was empty. Then, suicide is the only way.

You may not be daring enough to commit suicide like Marilyn Monroe. You may be very cowardly and commit suicide very slowly— you may take seventy years to commit it— but still it will be a suicide. Unless you have something inside you that is not dependent on anything outside, that is just your own—a world, a space of your own where you can close your eyes and move, and you can forget that anything else exists—you will be committing suicide.

Life arises from that inner source and spreads into the sky outside. There has to be a balance—I am always for balance. So I will not say that your life should be an open book, no. A few chapters open, okay. And a few chapters completely closed, a complete mystery. If you are just an open book you will be a prostitute, you will just be standing in the marketplace naked, with just the radio on. No, that won't do.

If your whole book is open, you will be just the day with no night, just the summer with no winter. Where will you rest, and where will you center yourself, and where will you take refuge? Where will you move when the world is too much? Where will you go to pray and meditate? No, half and half is perfect. Let half of your book be open—open to everybody, available to everybody— and let the other half of your book be so secret that only rare guests are allowed there.

Only rarely is somebody allowed to move within your temple. That is how it should be. If the crowd is coming in and going out, then the temple is no longer a temple. It may be a waiting room in an airport, but it cannot be a temple. Only rarely, very rarely, do you allow somebody to enter your self. That is what love is.


WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED WITH OTHERS. From the moment the child leaves the
mother's womb, he is never alone—he is with the mother, with the family, with friends, with other people. The circle of acquaintances,
friendships, relationships, becomes bigger and bigger, and a crowd gathers around him.
That's what we call life. And the more people are there in your life, the more you think you
have a rich life.

When you start moving inward, all those faces fade away, all that crowd disperses. You
have to say good-bye to everybody: Even to your closest friend, your lover, you have to say
good-bye. A moment comes where even your lover cannot be with you. That is the moment
when you are again entering the same space as you were in the womb of the mother. But
then you were not acquainted with the crowd, so you never felt alone. The child was
perfectly happy in the mother's womb because there was no comparison, all was joy.
Because he never knew the other, he could not feel lonely or alone—he had no idea. That
was the only reality that he knew.

But now you have known the crowd, relationships, the joys and miseries of relationship, and both are there. Moving again inward, the world starts disappearing, becomes like an echo, and soon even the echo disappears and one is utterly lost. But this is just an interpretation. If you can go in a little bit more, suddenly you will find yourself-— and for the first time you will find yourself. Then you will be surprised: You were lost in the crowd; now you are not lost. You were lost in that jungle of relationship, and now you have come home. Then again you can come back into the world, but you will be a totally different person. You will relate, but you will not depend; you will love, but your love will not be a need. You will love, but you will not possess; you will love, but you will not be jealous. And when love is without jealousy, without possessiveness, it is divine. You will be with people. In fact, only then can you be with people because you are; now you can be with people. First you were not, so the whole idea of being with people was just illusory, a kind of dream.
                                   Unless you are, how can you relate? Unless you are,
                                   how can you be with the other? It is just a fiction that we create; it is a delusion.

Unless you are centered, unless you know who you are, you cannot really relate. The relationship that goes on without self-knowledge is just an illusion. The other thinks he is relating to you, you think you are relating to him; neither do you know yourself nor does he know himself. So who is relating to whom? There is nobody! Just two shadows playing a game. And since both are shadows, there is no substance in the relationship. That's what I observe continuously: People relate, but there is nothing substantial. They relate because they are afraid that if they don't relate, they will fall into loneliness and feel lost, so they jump again and start relating. Any kind of relationship is better than no relationship; even if it is enmity it is okay; at least one feels occupied. Your so-called love is nothing but a kind of enmity, a polite way of fighting, struggling, nagging, dominating, a civilized way of torturing each other.

So you have to go into this space. Gather courage and go into it. Even if it feels very sad and very lonely, there is nothing to be worried about; we have to pay this price. And once you have reached your source, the whole thing will change completely, and you will come out of it as an individual. That is the difference I make between an individual and a person: A person is a false phenomenon, an individual is a reality. Persons, personalities, are masks, shadows; individuality is substance, it is reality. And only individuals can relate, can love—persons can only play games.
