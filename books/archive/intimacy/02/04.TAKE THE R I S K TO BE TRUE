TAKE THE RISK TO BE TRUE

No relationship can truly grow if you go on holding back. If you remain clever and go on safeguarding and protecting yourself, only personalities meet, and the essential centers remain alone. Then only your mask is related, not you. Whenever such a thing happens, there are four persons in the relationship, not two. Two false persons go on meeting, and the two real persons remain worlds apart.

Risk is there—if you become true, nobody knows whether this relationship will be capable of understanding truth, authenticity; whether this relationship will be strong enough to stand in the storm. There is a risk, and because of it people remain very, very guarded. They say things that should be said, they do things that should be done; love becomes more or less like a duty. But then the reality remains hungry, and the essence is not fed. So the essence becomes sadder and sadder. The lies of the personality are a very heavy burden on the essence, on the soul. The risk is real, and there is no guarantee about it, but I will tell you that the risk is worth taking.

At the most, the relationship can break—at the most. But it is better to be separate and real than unreal and together because then it is never going to be satisfying. Benediction will never come out of it. You will remain hungry and thirsty, and you will go on dragging, just waiting for some miracle to happen.

For the miracle to happen you will have to do something, and that is: Start being true. At the risk that maybe the relationship is not strong enough and may not be able to bear it— the truth may be too much, unbearable—but then that relationship is not worthwhile. So that test has to be passed.

Risk everything for truth; otherwise you will remain discontented. You will do many things, but nothing will really happen to you. You will move much, but you will never arrive anywhere. The whole effect will be almost absurd. It is as if you are hungry and you simply fantasize about food—beautiful, delicious. But fantasy is fantasy; it is not real. You cannot eat unreal food. For moments you can delude yourself, you can live in a dreamlike world, but a dream is not going to give you anything. It will take many things from you, and it will not give you anything in return. The time that you spend using a false personality is simply wasted; it will never come back to you again. Those same moments could have been real, authentic. Even a single moment of authenticity is better than a whole life of inauthentic living. So don't be afraid. The mind will say to you to go on safeguarding the other and yourself, to keep safe. That's how millions of people are living.

Freud in his last days wrote in a letter to a friend that as far as he had observed through his life—and he really observed deeply; nobody has observed so deeply, so penetratingly, so persistently and so scientifically—one conclusion seems absolutely certain; that people cannot live without lies. Truth is dangerous. Lies are very sweet but unreal. Delicious! You go on saying sweet nothings to your lover, and he goes on whispering in your ear sweet (but) nothings. And meanwhile life goes on slipping out of your hands, and everybody is coming closer and closer to death.

Before death comes, remember one thing: Love has to be lived before death happens. Otherwise you live in vain, and the whole of your life will be futile, a desert. Before death comes, make it a certainty that love has happened. But that is possible only with the truth. So be true. Risk everything for truth, and never risk truth for anything else. Let this be the fundamental law: Even if I have to sacrifice myself, my life, I am going to sacrifice it for truth, but truth I will never sacrifice for anything. And tremendous happiness will be yours, undreamed of benedictions will shower on you.

Once you are true, everything else becomes possible. If you are false—just a facade, a painted thing, a face, a mask—nothing is possible. Because with the false only the false happens, and with the truth, truth.

I understand the problem, the problem of all lovers, that deep down they are afraid. They go on wondering whether this relationship will be strong enough to bear truth. But how can you know beforehand? There is no a priori knowledge. One has to move into it to know it. How are you to know, sitting inside your house, whether you will be able to withstand the storm and the wind outside? You have never been in the storm. Go and see! Trial and error is the only way. Go and see—maybe you will be defeated, but even in that defeat you will have become stronger than you are right now.

If one experience defeats you, then another and another, by and by the very going through the storm will make you stronger and stronger and stronger. A day comes when one simply starts delighting in the storm, one simply starts dancing in the storm. Then the storm is not the enemy—that, too, is an opportunity, a wild opportunity, to be.

Remember, being never happens comfortably, otherwise it would have happened to all.
Remember, being cannot happen conveniently, otherwise everybody would have being
without any problem. Being happens only when you take risks, when you move in danger. And love is the greatest danger there is. It demands you totally.

                                 So don't be afraid, go into it. If the relationship survives truth, it will be beautiful. If it dies, then, too, it is good because one false relationship has ended and now you will be more capable of moving into another relationship, truer, more solid, more concerning the essence.

But remember always, falsity never pays; it appears to, but it never pays. Only truth pays—and in the beginning truth never looks like it will pay It seems it will shatter everything. If you look at it from the outside, truth looks very very dangerous, terrible. But this is an outside view. If you go in, truth is the only beautiful thing. And once you start cherishing it, tasting it, you will demand more and more because it will bring contentment.

Have you watched it? It's easier to be true with strangers. People traveling in a train
start talking with strangers, and they assert things they have never asserted to their friends
because with the stranger, nothing is involved. After half an hour your station will come, and
you will get off; you will forget, and he will forget what you have said. So whatever you
have said makes no difference. Nothing is at stake with a stranger.

People talking to strangers are truer, and they reveal their heart. But talking with
friends, with relatives—father, mother, wife, husband, brother, sister—there is a deep unconscious inhibition. "Don't say this, he may feel hurt.
Don't do that, she won't like it. Don't behave in this
way, Father is old, he may be shocked." So one goes on
controlling. By and by, the truth is dropped into the
basement of your being, and you become very clever
and cunning with the untrue. You go on smiling false
smiles, which are just painted on the lips. You go on
saying good things, meaning nothing. You are getting
bored with your boyfriend or your father, but you go on
saying, "I am so glad to see you!" And your whole
being says, "Now leave me alone!" But verbally you go
on pretending. And they are doing the same thing;
nobody becomes aware because we are all moving in
the same boat.

A religious person is one who comes out of this boat and risks his life. He says, "Either
I want to be true, or I don't want to be at all. But I am not going to be false."

Whatsoever the stakes, try it, but don't go on moving in a false way. The relationship may be strong enough. It may bear the truth. Then it is very, very beautiful. If you cannot be true to the person you love, then where will you be true? Where? If you cannot be true to the person whom you think loves you—if you are afraid even with them to reveal the truth, to be totally spiritually naked, if even there you are hiding—then where will you find the place and space where you can be totally free?

That's the meaning of love, that at least in one person's presence we can be totally nude. We know that he loves, so he will not mis-understand. We know that he loves, so the fear disappears. One can reveal all. One can open all the doors, one can invite the person to come in. One can start participating in another's being.

Love is participation, so at least with the lover don't be untrue. I'm not saying to go into the marketplace and be true because that will create unnecessary trouble right now. But start with the lover, then with the family, then with people who are farther away. By and by you will learn that to be true is so beautiful that you are willing to lose everything for it. Then in the marketplace—then truth simply becomes your way of life. The alphabet of love, truth, has to be learned with those who are very close because they will understand.
