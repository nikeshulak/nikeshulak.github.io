STUCK ON SECURITY

No relationship can be secure. It is not the nature of relationships to be secure, and if any
relationship is secure, it will lose all attraction. So this is a problem for the mind. If you want
to enjoy a relationship, it has to be insecure. If you make it completely secure, absolutely
secure, then you cannot enjoy it—it loses all charm, all attraction. The mind cannot be
satisfied either with this or with that, so it is always in
conflict and chaos. It wants a relationship that is alive and
secure, but this is impossible because an alive person, or an
alive relationship, or anything that is alive, has to be
unpredictable. What is going to happen in the next moment
cannot be forecast. And because it is unpredictable, this
moment becomes intense.

You have to live this moment as totally as possible
because the next moment may not come ever. You may not
be there; the other may not be there. Or you may both be
there, but the relationship is not. All possibilities remain
open. The future always remains open, the past is always
closed. And in between the two is the present, a single
moment of present, always trembling, shaking. But this is
how life is. The shaking and the trembling are part of being
alive—the hesitation, the cloudiness, the vagueness.

The past is closed. Everything has happened, and now nothing can be changed, so
everything is absolutely closed. The future is ab-
solutely open, nothing can be predicted. And between the two is the present, with one foot
in the past, one in the future. So the mind always remains in a dichotomy, in a divided state.

It is always split, it is always schizophrenic.

You need to understand that this is how things are, and nothing can be done about it. If
you want to have a very secure relationship, then you will have to love a dead man; but then
you will not enjoy it. That's what happens to a lover when he becomes a husband—a
husband is a dead lover, a wife is a dead lover. The
past has become all, and now the past decides the
future. In fact, if you are a wife you don't have a
future—the past will go on repeating itself, all the
doors are closed. If you are a husband, then you don't
have a future; then you are confined, in an
imprisonment.

So security is sought continuously, but when you
find it you get fed up with it. Look at the faces of
husbands and wives. They have found security—the
much-sought-after security—and now everything is in
their bank balance, and the law and the court and the
constable are all there to make everything secure. But
now the whole charm, the whole poetry, is lost;
romance is no more. Now they are dead people—they
are simply repeating the past, they live in memories.

Listen to wives and husbands talking. The wife goes on
saying that the , husband doesn't love her as he used to,
and they go on talking about past moments, their
honeymoon and other
things. What nonsense! You are still alive. This moment can be a honeymoon. This moment
can be lived, but you are talking of the past and trying to repeat it.

Security never satisfies—and in insecurity there is
fear, fear that the relationship can be lost. But that is part of
being alive. Everything can be lost, nothing is certain, and
that's why everything is so beautiful. And that's why you
need not postpone for a single moment— if you want to
love a person, love them here, now. Love them. Because
nobody knows what is going to happen in the next moment.

The next moment there may be no possibility for love, and
then you will repent for the whole of your life. You could
have loved, you could have lived. Then remorse surrounds
a person, repentance and a deep guilt is felt, as if you have
been committing suicide.

Life is uncertain. No one can make it certain. There is
no way to make it certain. And it is good that nobody can make it certain; otherwise, it
would be dead. Life is fragile, delicate, always moving into the unknown; that's its beauty.

One needs to be courageous, adventurous. One needs to be a gambler to move with life. So
be a gambler. Live this moment, and live it totally. When the next moment comes, we will
see. You will be there to tackle it—as you have been able to tackle the past, you will be able
to tackle the future also—and you will be more capable because you will be more
experienced.

So it is not a question of whether the other is going to be there the next moment. The
question is that if he is available to you in this
moment, love him. Don't waste this moment in thinking
and worrying about the future because this is suicidal.

Don't pay a single thought to the future because nothing
can be done about it, so it is a sheer waste of energy.

Love this man and be loved by him.

This is my understanding: that if you live this
moment totally, there is every possibility that in the next
moment the person may be still available. I say may be—
I can't promise you. But the possibility is greater because
the next moment is going to come out of this one. If you
have loved the man, and the man feels blessed, and the
relationship has been a beautiful experience, an ecstasy,
then why should he leave you?
In fact, if you go on worrying, you are making him,
forcing him, to leave you. And if you have wasted this
moment, the next moment will come out of this wastage;
it is going to be rotten. And that is how one becomes
self-predictable. You go on fulfilling your own
prophecies. The next moment you say, "Yes, I was
saying from the very beginning that this relationship was
not going to last. Now it is proven." Then you feel very good in a way; you feel you have
been very clever and wise. In fact, you have been foolish because it is not that you predicted
anything. You forced this event to happen because you wasted the time, the opportunity, that
was given to you. So love the person and forget about the future. Just drop the whole
nonsense of thinking about it. If you can love, love.





If you cannot love, forget this one, find somebody else. But
don't waste time.

The question is not of this lover or that lover, the question is
of love. Love fulfills, people are just excuses. But the whole
thing depends on you because whatsoever you are doing
with one person, you will go on doing with another. If you
make a person happy, why should he leave you? But if you
make him unhappy, then why shouldn't he leave you? If
you make him unhappy, then I will help him to leave you!
But if you make him happy, nobody can help him to leave
you; then there is no point; he will fight the whole world for
you.

So become happier. Use the time that you have—and
there is no need to think about the future; the present is
enough. From this very moment, try to
live this moment. Use this moment not in worrying but in
living.

Small things can become so beautiful. A little caring, a little
sharing,
that's all life is.



EVERY MAN CREATES A CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL SECURITY, unaware of the fact
that his security is his prison. People are surrounded by all kinds of insecurities; hence the
natural desire is to create a protection. This protection becomes bigger and bigger as you
become more alert to the dangers you are living through. Your prison
cell becomes smaller; you start living so well
protected that life itself becomes impossible.

Life is possible only in insecurity. This is
something very fundamental to be understood: Life
in its very essence is insecurity. While you are
protecting yourself, you are destroying your very
life. Protection is death because only those who are
dead in their graves are absolutely protected.

Nobody can harm them, nothing can go wrong for
them.

There is no longer any death for them, all that has
happened. Nothing more is going to happen.

Do you want the security of a graveyard? Unknowingly that's what everybody is trying
to do. Their ways are different, but the goal is the same. By money, by power, by prestige, by
social conformity, by belonging to a herd—religious, political—by being part of a family, a
nation, what are you seeking? An unknown fear surrounds you, and you start creating as
many barriers as possible between you and the fear. But those same barriers are going to
prevent you from living. Once this is understood, you will know the meaning of sannyas. It is
accepting life as insecurity, dropping all defenses and allowing life to take possession of you.

This is a dangerous step, but those who are capable of taking it are rewarded immensely
because only they live. Others just survive.

There is a difference between survival and living. Survival is only a dragging—
dragging from the cradle to the grave, wondering when the grave is going to come. In the
space between the cradle and the
grave, why be afraid? Death is certain . . . and you don't
have anything to lose. You come without anything. Your
fears are just projections. You don't have anything to lose,
and one day what you have is bound to disappear. If death
were uncertain, there would be some substance in the idea
of creating security. If you could avoid death, then naturally
it would be perfectly right to create barriers between you
and death. But you cannot avoid it. Death is there—once
accepted it loses all power, nothing can be done about it.

When nothing can be done about it, then why be bothered?
It is a well-known fact that soldiers going to the war are
trembling. Deep down they know that all will not be
returning back in the evening. Who will return and who will not return is not known, but it is
possible that perhaps they themselves may not be returning home. But psychologists have
been observing a strange phenomenon: As the soldiers reach the war front, all their fears
disappear. They start fighting very playfully. Once death is accepted, then where is its sting?
Once they know that death is possible at any moment, then they can forget all about it. I have
been with many army people, I had many friends in the army, and it was strange to see that
they are the most joyous people, the most relaxed. Any day the call can come—"join the
forces"—but they play cards, they play golf, they drink, they dance. They enjoy life to the
fullest.

One of the generals used to come to me. I asked him, "You are prepared almost every
day for death—how can you manage still to be happy?"

He said, "What else is there to do? Death is
certain."
Once the certainty, unavoidability, inescapability
is accepted, then rather than crying and weeping and
complaining and dragging yourself toward the grave,
why not dance? Why not make the most of the time
that you have between the cradle and the grave? Why
not live every moment to such totality that if the next
moment never comes, there is no complaint? You can
die joyously because you have lived joyously.

But very few people have understood the inner
working of their own psychology. Rather than living,
they start protecting. The same energy that could have
become a song and a dance becomes involved in
creating more money, more power, more ambition,
more security. The same energy that could have been a
tremendously beautiful flower of love becomes just an
imprisonment in a marriage.

Marriage is secure—by law, by social convention, by your own idea of respectability
and what people will say. Everybody is afraid of everybody else, so people go on pretending.

Love disappears—it is not in your hands. It comes just like the breeze conies, and it goes just
like the breeze goes. Those who are alert and aware dance with the breeze, relish it to its
deepest potential, enjoy its coolness and fragrance. And when it is gone, they are not sorry
and sad. It was a gift from the unknown. It may come again. They wait—and it comes again
and again. They learn, slowly, a deep patience and waiting. But most hu-
man beings down the centuries have done the very opposite. Afraid that the breeze may
escape, they close all the doors, all the windows, all possible cracks from where it can
escape. This is their arrangement for security; this is called marriage. But now they are
shocked— when all the windows and the doors are closed, and they have plugged even small
cracks, instead of having a great, cool, fragrant breeze they have only a stale, dead air!
Everybody feels it, but it needs courage to recognize that they have destroyed the beauty of
the breeze by capturing it.

In life, nothing can be captured and imprisoned. One has to live in openness, allowing
all kinds of experiences to happen, being fully grateful as long as they last. Thankful, but not
afraid of tomorrow. If today has brought a beautiful morning, a beautiful sunrise, songs of
birds, great flowers, why be worried about tomorrow?
Because tomorrow will be another today. Maybe the
sunrise will have different
colors. Maybe the birds will change their songs a little,
maybe there will be rain clouds and the dance of the
rain. But that has its own beauty, that has its own
nourishment.

It is good that things go on changing; that every
evening is not the same, that every day is not exactly a
repetition. Something new—that is the very excitement
and ecstasy of life, otherwise man will be so bored.

And those who have made their life completely secure
are bored. They are bored with their wives, they are
bored with their children, they
are bored with their friends. Boredom is the experience of millions of people, although they
smile to hide it.

Friedrich Nietzsche says, "Don't think I am a happy man. I smile just to prevent my
tears. I become busy in smiling so I can prevent my tears. If I don't smile, tears are bound to
come." Completely wrong attitudes have been taught to people: Hide your tears, remain
always at a distance, keep others at least at arm's length. Don't allow others too close because
then they may know your inner misery, your boredom, your anguish; they may know your
sickness.

The whole of humanity is sick for the simple reason that we have not allowed life's insecurity to be our very religion. Our gods are our security, our virtues are our security, our knowledge is our security, our relationships are our securities. We are wasting our whole lives in accumulating security bonds. Our virtues, austerities, are nothing but an effort to be secure even after death. It is creating a bank balance in the other world.

But meanwhile a tremendously beautiful life is slipping out of your hands. The trees are so beautiful because they don't know the fear of insecurity. The wild animals have such grandeur because they don't know that there is death, that there is insecurity. The flowers can dance in the sun and in the rain because they are not concerned about what is going to happen in the evening. Their petals will fall, and just as they had appeared from an unknown source they will disappear back into the same unknown source. But meanwhile, between these two points of appearance and disappearance, you have the opportunity either to dance or to despair.

An authentic person simply drops the idea of security and starts living in utter insecurity because that is the nature of life. You cannot change it. That which you cannot change, accept—and accept it with joy. Don't unnecessarily hit your head against the wall, just pass through the door.
