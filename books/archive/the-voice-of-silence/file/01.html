<div class="libtop" ondragstart="return false" onselectstart="return false"><div class="libover">&nbsp;</div><h3 style="margin:15px 0;"></h3><p class="Onlib_Text">Part 1</p><p class="Onlib_Sutra">These rules are written for all disciples: Attend you to them.<br><br>Before the eyes can see,<br>they must be incapable of tears.<br>Before the ear can hear,<br>it must have lost its sensitiveness.<br>Before the voice can speak<br>in the presence of the Masters,<br>it must have lost the power to wound.<br>Before the soul can stand<br>in the presence of the Masters,<br>its feet must be washed in the blood of the heart.<br><br>1. Kill out ambition.<br><br>Ambition is the first curse:<br>the great tempter of the man<br>who is rising above his fellows.<br>It is the simplest form of looking for reward.<br>Men of intelligence and power are led away from their higher possibilities by it continually.<br>Yet it is a necessary teacher.<br>Its results turn to dust and ashes in the mouth; like death and estrangement, it shows the man at last that to work for self<br>is to work for disappointment.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">I called you and you have come. To come outwardly is very easy but until you also come to me inwardly, your outer coming or not coming does not have much meaning. One who can come outwardly, who has a thirst and longing, can also come from the inside too. The outer coming is a proof that you are searching, but that proof alone is not enough. It is an indication, and it is a good indication; it is necessary, but it is not enough. You have to come inwardly too. And before that inner journey can begin, it is necessary for you to understand a few things about yourself – because it is you who will make this journey. No one else can make this journey on your behalf. In this world, it is not possible to see with someone else’s eyes, nor is it possible to walk with someone else’s feet. Here, you have to die for yourself and you have to live for yourself. Here, nobody can take your place.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">That is why it is necessary first of all to understand a few things about yourself – because if there is a misconception about that, then even a right path will take you to a wrong place. If you do not have the right understanding about yourself, you will turn even a right path into one that takes you to the wrong destination. And if you have a right understanding about yourself, then there is no path that will not take you to the right place. Even wrong paths can reach to the right destination; what is needed is the right traveler. It all depends on the traveler. It is not the path that takes the traveler to the destination, it is the traveler who reaches.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">The path changes in accordance with you. As you are, so becomes the path. That is why there are no ready-made paths on which you can walk blindly.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">The first thing is to have the right understanding about yourself, because it is out of <i>you</i> that the path will be born, and in the end the destination will also arise from you.</p></div>

<div class="libtop" ondragstart="return false" onselectstart="return false"><div class="libover">&nbsp;</div><h3 style="margin:15px 0;"></h3><p class="Onlib_Text">You are everything – you are the seed and you will also become the tree. And when the flowers bloom and the fragrance emanates from them, then it is you who will be in those flowers and in that fragrance. If you have the wrong understanding about yourself, then all your hard work will go to waste.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">The first thing: the first thing for you to understand about yourself is that you don’t know anything. If you did know, then there would have been no need for you to come to me. If you are able to catch hold of even one ray of sunlight, then the whole path which reaches to the sun has opened up because by catching that ray you can reach to its original source, the sun. And if you are able to taste even one drop of the ocean, then you have tasted the whole ocean. If you know even a little bit of life, then there is no need to ask anyone anything. With the help of that little bit that you know, you can keep moving on ahead.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">It is as if a man takes a small lamp and walks in the darkness, and the way is lit for only two steps; but when he has taken those two steps, two more steps are lit up and then when he has taken those two steps, two more steps are lighted. With a lamp which can shed light on only two steps, you can complete a journey of a thousand miles. There is no need to light up the whole thousand miles. Even if you have a small lamp in your hand, even then, the journey along the longest of long, dark roads can be completed. Two steps are enough.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">If you knew even a little bit about yourself, then there would have been no need for you to come to me; there would have been no need for you to go to anyone. So the first thing is that you understand this rightly: as yet, you don’t know anything about yourself, and whatever you may know is just words. But words have no life and no meaning. In this world, there is nothing more false than words.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Experience, yes – experience has meaning. I may talk as much as I want, but I cannot put my experience into words. Nobody has ever been able to do it and nobody will ever be able to do it – because whatever I know is <i>my</i> experience. And when I put that into words, what you hear is not the experience, but empty words.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">I say <i>God</i> and you hear it, I say soul and you also hear it, but there is no meaning in the words <i>soul</i> or <i>God</i>. What you are hearing is just words, and by hearing them again and again an illusion is created that you have understood. The knowledge of words is another name for foolishness.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">You don’t know anything. Please let this be clear; this is fundamental. Because if a person who does not know starts to think that he knows, then all the doors to knowing close for him. If a sick person believes that he is healthy, then the search for a cure stops. If an ignorant person thinks that he is wise, then this so-called wisdom will lead him much farther astray than his ignorance would have.</p></div>

<div class="libtop" ondragstart="return false" onselectstart="return false"><div class="libover">&nbsp;</div><h3 style="margin:15px 0;"></h3><p class="Onlib_Text">If you can understand that you don’t know anything, then that is the first ray of wisdom. Now you have become honest. Now you have at least accepted one truth: that you don’t know anything. You have put your scriptures aside and you have left your words behind. You have become honest. You have become authentic with yourself in seeing that you don’t know anything about your soul or about salvation; you don’t know what life is all about. This acceptance of your ignorance is the first step of wisdom.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">If any wise person happens to have come here, please go back. I will be able to work only with those who are aware of their ignorance. Your knowledge will become a barrier for you. And if you already know, what is the need to make unnecessary efforts here? And please understand this rightly – only if you are sick will I give you medicine; only if you are ignorant will I try to take you towards wisdom; only if you are in darkness will I show you the path to light. But if you are already standing in the light, then don’t waste your efforts and mine. It is very easy to wake a man who is sleeping, but it is very difficult to wake a man who is pretending to be asleep.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">The second thing: the life of every person is a search for only one thing – how to get rid of suffering, how to attain happiness. There is only one thirst, one search. Even if a tree is rising out of the ground towards the sky, it is on this search. Every bird that flies, every animal that moves, every man that lives…they are all this same search. In existence, the inner search of even a stone is for happiness. So the second thing to keep in mind is, what are you searching for?</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Many people go straight into the search for godliness, but that search is difficult. It is difficult because there is no deep inner thirst for it. If you follow your thirst, then one day perhaps that thirst may ripen into the thirst for godliness – but it is not yet the case. Understand this rightly, that right now your search is for bliss. Maybe this search will take you farther – maybe the Ganges coming out of this little Gangotri will move farther on.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Slowly, slowly, as your search deepens, you may realize that bliss is another name for godliness; you may realize that bliss is one of the attributes of godliness. And you may come to know that your search is not only for bliss, but for something greater. But the initial search is for happiness, not for godliness.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Some people get involved with godliness right at the start; then it becomes difficult. Their effort to become a tree begins without first becoming a seed. Then there will be problem. Then there will be much running around, but with no result – and when no result comes, they are disappointed and in despair.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">So one thing is that you have come here in search of bliss. Drop this God. There is no hurry. Start your journey with the search for bliss, and it will end with your attaining to godliness. But don’t begin with it. It is appropriate to start the climb from the first rung; the beginning should be from <i>a</i>, then to <i>b</i> and then to <i>c</i>. Everyone understands bliss, even if he is an atheist. Whether he is a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Christian or a Jaina; whether he believes in God or not; whether he has faith in religion or not; he may be anybody but the search for bliss is universal. So let us begin with that which everyone is searching for.</p></div>

<div class="libtop" ondragstart="return false" onselectstart="return false"><div class="libover">&nbsp;</div><h3 style="margin:15px 0;"></h3><p class="Onlib_Text">In this world, if we could only accept this universal search, there would not be disputes between so many religions. Hindu, Mohammedan and Christian would not fight each other; there would not be any contention between Hindus and Jainas. But instead we begin our search for God, and we don’t know anything about godliness. We have no strong desire to search for it, nor do we have any reason to do so. So we fight about words, so we make different wordy interpretations about a God whom we don’t know at all. Then there is conflict between these different interpretations; then temples, mosques and <i>gurudwaras </i>come into being, and man unnecessarily suffers.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Begin with bliss: then there is no problem or conflict even for the atheist. Then whether you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan, there is no question – because if you are searching for bliss, you are searching for the thing that every living being is searching for. About this, everyone agrees. And slowly, slowly, as the search becomes deeper, you will come to know that the search for bliss has become the search for godliness.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">The third thing to keep in mind is that you want to search for bliss, but what will you give for it? What will you pay for it – with what? What do you have that you will give in return?</p><p class="Onlib_Text">In order for a man to take even one step, he has to leave the piece of ground on which he was standing; only then can he go forward. There is no progress in this world if he is not willing to leave something behind. Without sacrifice you cannot take even one step. If your hands are full of mud, pebbles, stones, and you want diamonds, you will have to let go of the stones. To grasp the desired object, your hands at least should be empty; you will have to let go of the useless things. So what do you have?</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Please don’t become afraid. I will not tell you to renounce your wealth – because no one has any wealth, no one at all. In this world, even the richest man is a pauper. Nobody has any wealth.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">There are two types of paupers: one is a poor pauper and the other is a rich pauper – but all are paupers. Up until now I have not seen a rich man. You can see many people who have money, but they are not rich. They are also in the rat race to grab as much as they can, just as the poorest of the poor are. Like a beggar holding on tightly to whatever he has got in his hand, just like that, the man who has the biggest safe is also holding on tightly to whatever <i>he</i> has. The tightness of their grip is the same, so their poverty is also the same.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">So you don’t have wealth – no one has – and that is why I don’t insist that you drop it. How can you let go of what you do not have? I don’t tell you to give up your life, because even that is not yours. How can you have a life that you are not even aware of? And each moment you are trembling with the fear of death. If you are life itself, why are you afraid of death?</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Life has no death. How can life ever become death? But you are trembling with the fear of death; each moment death is surrounding you. You are trying to save yourself in whatever way you can so that you don’t disappear, so that you don’t die and you don’t come to an end. And you don’t even have life! That is why I will not tell you to give up your life. How can you give up what you don’t have?</p></div>

<div class="libtop" ondragstart="return false" onselectstart="return false"><div class="libover">&nbsp;</div><h3 style="margin:15px 0;"></h3><p class="Onlib_Text">I will ask from you only that which you have. And I will ask for that which everyone has. Just as I said that everyone’s search is for bliss, in the same way there is one kind of wealth that everyone has – and that is their suffering. You have plenty of that, you have more than you need. For many lives you have not collected anything else; you have collected piles of it! Even Mount Everest will seem small compared to the piles of troubles that you have collected; your problems are so big that even Mount Everest will feel embarrassed in front of them! And perhaps even Hillary and Tensing would not be able to climb the mountains of your sufferings – they are so big. They are your efforts from many lives; you have not earned anything apart from your suffering. Even now, you are earning it.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">I would like you to let go of your suffering, to renounce your suffering. Nobody ever asks for your suffering – but I do. And if you can give up your suffering then the path to happiness can be opened up. If you can manage to let go of your suffering you will come to realize that what you thought was suffering was nothing but an illusion; that suffering was not holding onto you – you were holding onto it. But you will only come to know who was holding on and who was being held when you let go.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">You are always asking how you can get rid of suffering. From your questions it appears as if suffering has got a hold on you and you want to be released from it. If suffering is holding onto you, you cannot possibly become free from it because the grip is not in your hands but in the hands of suffering. Then you are helpless. And if after so many lives you still haven’t managed to become free, how can you suddenly become free now?</p><p class="Onlib_Text">I say to you that suffering is not holding onto you, you are holding onto suffering. And if you can agree to look into what I am saying, you will come to understand it for yourself. Not only will you come to understand it, but you will experience a letting go – and you will come to know how suffering can be dropped. And when you become good at the art of letting go of suffering, then one day you will realize that you were dragging it around with you – and no one except you was responsible for this. Whatever suffering you experienced, nobody else was to blame. It was your wish, you wanted to suffer. Whatsoever we wish for comes to pass. And whatsoever you are is the fruit of your wishes. Neither God is responsible, nor luck; no one has any investment in causing you trouble.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">The truth is that existence is always eager to make you blissful. This whole existence wants your life to become a celebration – because when you are unhappy you also throw unhappiness all around you; when you are unhappy then the stink from your wounds reaches to the whole of existence. And when you are unhappy existence also feels pain. This whole universe feels pain when you are unhappy and rejoices when you are joyful. Existence has no wish for you to be unhappy: that would be suicidal for existence itself. But you are unhappy, and to become unhappy you have developed a certain system. Until this is destroyed, you will never be able to open your eyes to happiness, to bliss.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">What is this system? What arrangement has man created to accumulate suffering? How does he collect it? Try to understand this a little – then perhaps it will be easier for you to let go of it.</p></div>

<div class="libtop" ondragstart="return false" onselectstart="return false"><div class="libover">&nbsp;</div><h3 style="margin:15px 0;"></h3><p class="Onlib_Text">Beginning tomorrow morning, we will start some experiments. If you want to weep sometimes… A small child wants to cry: psychologists say that the act of crying in a child is a catharsis. Whenever tension builds up in the child, then by weeping he throws out his tension. You too were a small child once. A small child is feeling hungry, he is not getting his milk on time, so he cries because he is filled with tension and he needs to let this tension out. He will cry, the tension will be released and he will feel lighter. But we teach him not to cry. We try to find all sorts of ways to prevent him from crying. We put toys in his hands so that he forgets; we put something artificial in his mouth, or we put his thumb in his mouth so that he mistakes it for his mother’s breast and he forgets. We begin to rock him to and fro so that his attention is diverted and he doesn’t cry. We try everything to prevent him from crying. That tension which could have been released by crying collects – it isn’t released. In this way we let it accumulate. Who knows how much pain and tears each person accumulates? And he sits on this collected pile.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Who knows how much tension you have collected? You have never wept heartfully nor have you ever laughed totally. Because you have not cried, something has become stuck in you; because you have not laughed, something has become stuck in you. You have never been wholeheartedly angry nor have you ever forgiven someone completely. You have become half-hearted. Your branches want to grow all around you, but they have not been able to. Leaves want to sprout from all sides, but they have not been able to. Your tree has been left bare. The name of this accumulated pain, this unreleased pain, is hell – and you are dragging it around with you.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">I have called you here so that your hell can be thrown out. And only <i>you</i> can throw it out. In this camp you should become like a small child. You should forget that you are cultured, that you are very educated, that you are in an important position, that you have wealth, that you are respected in the city. Drop all that! Become like a newborn baby who has no reputation, no education, no position, no wealth, no prestige. If you want to save your prestige and reputation, then before tomorrow morning please run from here as fast as you can and don’t even look back. I am not here to support these things. Save your prestige and position, your wisdom and your respectability, and run away. Don’t stay here.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">I am here for those who are ready to become simple, like children. Only then can I do something – because only children can be taught something, only children can be changed. A revolution can occur only in the lives of children.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">In the meditation experiments which will happen here, cathart, throw out all the suffering that you have in your heart. If you have anger, throw it out into the sky. If you have violence, throw it out into the sky. You don’t have to be violent with anyone; just release it into the open sky. Suffering, pain, anguish – whatsoever is inside has to be thrown out. You have to throw it out with as much totality as you can. Use your total energy, so that whatever pain is inside you is expressed.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">You should understand that until you express the pain you have buried in your unconscious, it will not leave you, it will remain buried. Express it, bring it to the conscious. Pull out whatever is buried in darkness inside; bring it to light.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Some things die in the light. If you pull the tree’s roots up from the darkness, they will die. They need darkness; they live in darkness, in darkness is their life. Just like roots, suffering lives also in darkness. Expose your suffering to the light and you will find that it is dead. If you keep on burying it inside, it will remain your constant companion for many lives. Unhappiness has to be brought to the light.</p></div>

<div class="libtop" ondragstart="return false" onselectstart="return false"><div class="libover">&nbsp;</div><h3 style="margin:15px 0;"></h3><p class="Onlib_Text">Understand one more thing: you have taken your pain into you from the outside; please return it to the outside. Pain is not inside. All your pain is brought in from the outside.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">When you are born, there is no suffering in your self-nature. There is no pain; pain is brought in from the outside. If a man has abused you and you have become unhappy, then you have brought the abuse in from the outside. Now you will accumulate this pain inside, you will let it grow. You will repress it, and then it will expand and poison each and every pore of your body. You will become an unhappy person. We bring suffering in from the outside – it is not in our intrinsic nature.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">That is why I say that you can become free from suffering. You cannot become free from your self-nature, but only from that which is other than your self-nature. You can become free only from that which is not yours. There is no way to become free from that which is yours.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Pain has to be thrown out. During these coming days, throw out as much pain as you can. And as you go on throwing it out, the understanding will grow that this was a strange madness you were nurturing! This could have been thrown out very easily, it was in your hands to do so, but you unnecessarily stopped yourself.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">And the second thing is that as you throw out the pain, as you throw it from the inside back to the outside from where it came, bliss will begin to arise from within you.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">Bliss is within. No one gives it to you from the outside. It doesn’t come from the outside; it is your nature, it is you. It is hidden within, it is your soul.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">If this rubbish which has been collected from the outside is thrown out, then the soul within begins to expand, it begins to grow. You begin to see its light and you begin to hear its soundless sound; you start to become immersed in an inner music. But this will only happen if you release the rubbish so that an inner sky is created, some space is created. Then that which is hidden inside can expand into this space. Pain has to be thrown out so that bliss can expand inside. And when bliss begins to expand from within, it is necessary for you to understand a second thing too: that if you repress pain, it grows. If pain is repressed it grows; if you express it, it diminishes. With bliss it is totally the opposite: if you repress bliss it diminishes, if you express bliss it increases.</p><p class="Onlib_Text">So the first thing is this: you have to throw out the pain, because it becomes less by being expressed. Don’t repress it, because it grows through being repressed. And when you have the first glimpses of bliss from within, then express that bliss…because the more you express bliss, the more it grows inside. Fresh layers of it will begin to unfold.</p></div>
