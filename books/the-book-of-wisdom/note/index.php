[148]</span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The three masters that Atisha remained with for many years were, first Dharmakirti, a great Buddhist mystic. He taught him no-mind, he taught him emptiness, he taught him how to be thoughtless, he taught him how to drop all content from the mind and be contentless. The second master was Dharmarakshita, another Buddhist mystic. He taught him love, compassion. The third master was Yogin Maitreya, another Buddhist mystic. He taught him the art of taking the suffering of others and absorbing it into your own heart: love in action. [18]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These are the three ways people reach to the ultimate. If you reach through emptiness you attain the other two also, but your path remains basically that of emptiness – you know more about emptiness, so emptiness will be emphasized in whatsoever you teach. [21]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That’s what happened in Buddha’s case. He had attained through emptiness, hence his whole teaching became emptiness-oriented. There is no God in Buddha’s teaching, because God is a thought, content, an object – God is the other, and Buddha had attained by dropping the other. Buddha had attained by emptying his mind totally, hence there is no place for God, no place for anything at all. His path is the purest via negativa. [22]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.np61jta0bplx"><span class="c17">You are a beggar with a begging bowl</span></h3><p class="c3"><span>Man lives in passion. </span><span class="c5">When the mind disappears, passion is transformed into compassion. Passion means you are a beggar with a begging bowl; you are asking and asking for more and more from everybody; you are exploiting others.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Your relationships are nothing but exploitations – cunning devices to possess the other, very clever strategies to dominate. When you are living in the mind, in passion, your whole life is power politics: even your love, even your social service, even your humanitarian works are nothing but power politics. Deep down, there is a desire to be powerful over others. [28]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The same energy, when the mind is dropped, becomes compassion, and it takes a totally new turn. It is no longer begging; you become an emperor, you start giving. Now you have something – you had it always, but because of the mind, you were not aware of it. The mind was functioning like darkness around you, and you were unaware of the light within. The mind was creating an illusion of being a beggar, while all the time you had been an emperor. </span><span class="c5">The mind was creating a dream – in reality, you never needed anything. Already all had been given.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;All that you need, all that you can need is already the case. [29]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Godliness is within you, but because of the mind – mind means dreaming, desiring – you never look within, you go on rushing outward.</span><span>&nbsp;You keep yourself in the background, your eyes are turned toward the outside; they have become focused there. That’s what the mind is all about: focusing the eyes on the outside. </span><span class="c5">One has to learn how to unfocus them from there – how to make them loose, less rigid, more liquid, so that they can turn inward.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Once you have seen who you are, the beggar disappears. In fact, it had never existed; it was just a dream, an idea. [30]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The mind is creating all your misery. </span><span class="c5">With the mind gone, misery is gone</span><span class="c0">, and suddenly you are full of energy and the energy needs expression, sharing; it wants to become a song, a dance, a celebration. That is compassion: you start sharing. [31]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the same way, compassion has two possibilities: the feminine and the masculine. From Dharmarakshita, Atisha learned the feminine art of being in love with existence. One more step was needed. Dharmarakshita told him, “Go to Yogin Maitreya” – these three masters were all living together in the same vicinity – “Go to Yogin Maitreya and learn how to transform the baser energy into active energy, so love becomes active,” and once love is active, compassion is active, you have passed through all the three dimensions of truth – you have known all. You have known utter emptiness, you have known compassion arising, you have known compassion showering. Life is fulfilled only when all these three have happened. [34]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>These seven points, the smallest treatise you can find, are of immense value. </span><span class="c5">You will have to meditate over each statement.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;They are the whole of religion condensed; you will have to unfold each statement. They are like seeds; they contain much. It may not be apparently so, but the moment you move into the statements deeply, when you contemplate and meditate and start experimenting with them, you will be surprised – you will be going into the greatest adventure of your life. [38]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.12a4uexiz2sn"><span class="c17">01-39 The first</span></h3><h3 class="c9" id="h.rjdgriwxwu1x"><span class="c17">First, learn the preliminaries. [40]</span></h3><h4 class="c13" id="h.u13wzfqoamue"><span class="c8">First: truth is.</span></h4><p class="c3"><span>What are the preliminaries? These are the preliminaries. </span><span class="c5">First: truth is.</span><span>&nbsp;Truth is not something to be created, truth is not something that is far away. </span><span class="c5">Truth is herenow; truth surrounds you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as the ocean surrounds the fish. The fish may not be aware – once the fish becomes aware of the ocean, the fish is enlightened. The fish is not aware, cannot be aware, because the fish is born in the ocean, has always lived in the ocean, is part of the ocean as any wave is part of the ocean. The fish is also a wave – a little more solid, but born out of the ocean, lives in the ocean and one day disappears in the ocean. The fish may never come to know about the ocean. To know something, a little distance is needed. To know something, perspective is needed. And the ocean is so close, that’s why the fish may not be aware of it. [41]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So is the case with truth, or if you like you can use the word God. So is the case with God. It is not that he is far away and that’s why we don’t know about him; it is because he is not far away but very close by. Even to say that it is close by is not right, because you are it. He is within you and without: he is all and all. [42]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is the first thing that has to be allowed to sink deep in your heart: truth already is, we are in it. This is the most fundamental thing to begin with. You are not to discover it; it is not covered. All that is needed is a new kind of awareness, which is missing in you. Truth is there, but you are not aware; you are not mindful, you are not alert. You don’t know how to watch, you don’t know how to observe, you don’t know how to look and see. You have eyes but still you are blind, you have ears but you are deaf. [43]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c21 c5">The first preliminary is truth is. [44]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h4 class="c13" id="h.klb8bnuzf4b3"><span class="c8">01-45 The mind is the barrier</span></h4><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The second preliminary is the mind is the barrier.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Nothing else is hindering you from truth, just your own mind. The mind surrounds you like a film, like a movie that goes on and on, and you remain engrossed in it, fascinated by it. It is a fantasy that surrounds you; a continuous story that goes on and on, and because you are so fascinated by it you go on missing that which is. The mind is not; it is only a fantasy, it is only a faculty for dreaming. [45]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The mind is nothing but dreams and dreams</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;– dreams of the past, dreams of the future, dreams of how things should be, dreams of great ambitions, achievements. Dreams and desires, that is the stuff mind is made of, but it surrounds you like a China Wall. Because of it the fish remains unaware of the ocean. [46]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5 c21">The second preliminary is the mind is the only barrier. [47]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h4 class="c13" id="h.xllnxw5pf05k"><span class="c8">01-48 No-mind is the door</span></h4><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The third: no-mind is the door.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Atisha calls no-mind bodhichitta: that is his word for no-mind. It can be translated as buddha-mind, buddha-consciousness, too or if you like you can call it christ-consciousness, krishna-consciousness. It doesn’t make any difference what name is used, but the basic quality of bodhichitta is that it is no-mind. It looks paradoxical: the mind in the state of no-mind. But the meaning is very clear: mind without content, mind without thoughts, is what is meant, is what is indicated. [48]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Remember the word bodhichitta, because Atisha says the whole effort of religion, the whole science of religion, is nothing but an endeavor to create bodhichitta, buddha-consciousness: a mind which functions as a no-mind, a mind which no longer dreams, no longer thinks, a mind which is just awareness, pure awareness. These are the preliminaries. [49]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.i473u3i82rnv"><span class="c17">01-50 The second sutra</span></h3><h3 class="c9" id="h.dfw9vvhparjz"><span class="c17">Think that all phenomena are like dreams. [51]</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now the work starts. Atisha is very condensed, seedlike. That is the meaning of a sutra: it is just a thread, just a hint, and then you have to decode it. Think that all phenomena are like dreams. [52]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Phenomena means all that you see, all that you experience. All that can ever be experienced, is all phenomena.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Remember, not only are the objects of the world phenomena and dreams, but also objects of consciousness. They may be objects of the world; they may be just objects of the mind. They may be great spiritual experiences. You may see kundalini rising in you: that too is a phenomenon – a beautiful dream, a very sweet dream, but it is a dream all the same. You may see great light flooding your being, but that light is also a phenomenon. You may see lotuses blooming inside you and a great fragrance arising within your being: those too are phenomena, because you are always the seer and never the seen, always the experiencer and never the experienced, always the witness and never the witnessed. [53]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>All that can be witnessed, seen, observed, is phenomena. Material phenomena, psychological phenomena, spiritual phenomena – they are all the same. There is no need to make any distinction. The basic thing to remember is </span><span class="c5">that which can be seen is a dream</span><span class="c0">. [54]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h4 class="c13" id="h.94ze6lh96imx"><span class="c8">Start contemplating in this way</span></h4><p class="c3"><span>Think that all phenomena are dreams. This is a tremendously powerful technique. Start contemplating in this way: if you are walking on the street, </span><span class="c5">contemplate that people passing by are all dreams: the shops, and the shopkeepers and the customers and the people coming and going; all </span><span>are dreams. </span><span class="c5">The houses, the buses, the train, the airplane</span><span class="c0">, all are dreams. [55]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Immediately, you will be surprised by something of tremendous import happening within you. The moment you think “All are dreams” suddenly, like a flash, one thing comes into your vision, “I am a dream too.” Because if the seen is a dream, then who is this “I”? If the object is a dream, then the subject is also a dream. If the object is false, how can the subject be the truth? Impossible! [56]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you watch everything as a dream, suddenly you will find something slipping out of your being: the idea of the ego. This is the only way to drop the ego, and the simplest. Just try it – meditate this way. Meditating this way, again and again, one day the miracle happens: you look in, and the ego is not found there. [57]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ego is a by-product, a by-product of the illusion that whatsoever you are seeing is true. If you think that objects are true, then the ego can exist; it is a by-product. If you think that objects are dreams, the ego disappears and if you think continuously that all is a dream, then one day, in a dream in the night, you will be surprised: suddenly in the dream, you will remember that this is a dream too. And immediately, as the remembrance happens, the dream will disappear. For the first time you will experience yourself deep asleep, yet awake – a very paradoxical experience, but of great benefit. [58]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Once you have seen your dream disappearing because you have become aware of the dream, your quality of consciousness will have a new flavor to it. The next morning you will wake up with a totally different quality you had never known before. You will wake up for the first time. Now you will know that all those other mornings were false; you were not really awake. The dreams continued – the only difference was that in the night you were dreaming with eyes closed, in the day you were dreaming with eyes open. [59]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If the dream has disappeared because awareness happened, suddenly you became aware in the dream. And remember, awareness and dreaming cannot exist together. Here, awareness arises, and there, the dream disappears. When you become awake in your sleep, the next morning is going to be something so important that it is incomparable. Nothing like it has ever happened. Your eyes will be so clear, so transparent, and everything will look so psychedelic, so colorful, so alive. Even rocks will be sen to be breathing, pulsating; even rocks will have a heartbeat. When you are awake, the whole existence changes its quality. [60]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We are living in a dream. We are asleep, even when we think we are awake. [61]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Think that all phenomena are like dreams. First, objects will lose their objectivity, and second, the subject will lose its subjectivity. And that brings you to a transcendence. The object is no longer important, the subject is no longer important; then what is left? A transcendental consciousness: bodhichitta – just a witnessing, with no idea of “I” and “thou”; just a pure mirror which reflects that which is. [62]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And existence is nothing but that which is. [63]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The third sutra: [64]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.65b26tlsoyx0"><span class="c17">Examine the nature of unborn awareness. [65]</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now you know what awareness is. You have known this transcendental awareness where objects and subjects are no longer existential. You have known for the first time this purity, this crystal clear mirror. Now examine the nature of this awareness. [66]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Look into it; look deep into it. Shake yourself into as full alertness as possible. Wake up and see, and you will start laughing – because now you will see there has never been a birth, and there is never going to be a death. [67]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is unborn and undying consciousness. It has always been here. It is eternal; it is timeless. How afraid you were of death, and how afraid you were of old age, and how afraid you were of a thousand and one things! And nothing has ever happened; all was a dream. [68]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing this, one smiles, one laughs. Your whole life up to now has been ridiculous, absurd. You were unnecessarily afraid, unnecessarily greedy, unnecessarily suffering. You were living in a nightmare and it was your own creation. [69]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Examine the nature of unborn awareness. And you are freed from all misery, all suffering, all hell. [70]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.2180mtnmjs7r"><span class="c17">Let even the remedy itself go free on its own. [71]</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now, don’t start clinging to the remedy, to the method. That temptation arises. It is the last temptation, the very last effort of the mind to survive. The mind comes from a back door; it tries once more. Before it disappears forever, it makes one more effort, and that effort is to cling to the method – the method of thinking that all phenomena are dreams. [72]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It has given you such joy, such a deep experience of reality that naturally you would like to cling to it. And once you cling you are back in the same old rut again: the mind is back in disguise. Cling to anything and the mind is back, because clinging is mind. Hold on to anything, depend on anything, and the mind is back, because the mind is dependence, slavery. Possess anything – even a spiritual method, even a method of meditation – become a possessor, and you will be possessed by it. Whether you possess money or you possess a tremendously significant method of meditation, it doesn’t matter. Whatsoever you possess, you will be possessed by it and you will be afraid to lose it. [73]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The master stayed with me for three days. On the third day, he was very angry and he said, “You have destroyed my thirty years’ work” – because I told him a simple thing – just this sutra of Atisha: Let even the remedy itself go… [77]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I told him, “Now for thirty years you have been remembering one thing, that all is divine. The tree is God, the rock is God, the people are God, the dog is God, everything is God – for thirty years you have been remembering it continuously,” and he had really made a sincere effort. [78]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He said, “Yes.” [79]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I said, “Now stop remembering. How long are you going to remember? If it has happened, then stop remembering and let us see what happens. If it has really happened, then even after dropping remembering, it will remain.” [80]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was so logical that he agreed. He said, “It has happened.” [81]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I said, “Then give it a try. For three days, forget remembering, stop remembering.” [82]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He said, “I cannot stop, it has become automatic.” [83]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I said, “Just wait and try.” [84]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It took him at least two days, forty-eight hours, to stop. It was hard to stop; it had become automatic. There was now no need to remember; for thirty years he had been remembering, it was simply there like an undercurrent, but within forty-eight hours it stopped. [85]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On the morning of the third day, he was very angry. He said, “What have you done? All that joy has disappeared. I am feeling very ordinary, I am feeling the same as I was before I started on the journey thirty years ago.” He started crying out of anger and out of sadness; tears started coming to his eyes. He said, “Give me back my method – please don’t take it!” [86]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I said, “Just look! If this is so dependent on the method, then nothing has happened. It is just an illusion that you are creating by continuous remembering. This is nothing but autohypnosis.” [87]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All the great masters say this, that one day you have to drop the method – and the sooner you drop it, the better. The moment you attain, the moment awareness is released in you, immediately drop the method. [88]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just look! This is only the fourth sutra. In the third sutra Atisha says: Examine the nature of unborn awareness. [89]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And in the fourth, immediately: Let even the remedy itself go… [90]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now there is no more examination, no more mindfulness, no more remembering that all is a dream. Once the first taste of awareness has happened on your tongue, be quick! Because the mind is very cunning – the mind can start telling you, “Look, you are no longer ordinary, you are extraordinary. Look, you have attained. Look, you have become a buddha, you are enlightened. Look, this is the goal of all human beings, and very rarely, one in a million attains. You are that one in a million.” [91]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The mind will say all these beautiful sweet nothings, and of course, the ego can come back. You can start feeling very good, holier than thou. You can start feeling special, spiritual, saintly, and all is lost. Through the remedy, the disease is back. Cling to the remedy, and the disease is back. [92]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One has to be very alert about dropping the method. Once you attain something, immediately drop the method, otherwise your mind will start clinging to the method. It will talk very logically to you, saying, “It is the method that is important.” [93]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They said, “We cannot leave this boat. This is the boat, which helped us to come from the other shore to this shore. How can we leave it? It is because of it that we have been able to come here. Without it, we would have died on the other shore. The night was coming close, and there were wild animals on the other shore. It was as sure as anything that by the morning we would have been dead. We will never leave this boat; we are indebted forever. We will carry it on our heads in sheer gratitude.” [95]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This can happen, because all minds are idiots. The mind as such is idiotic. [96]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The origin of the word idiot is beautiful to remember. Idiocy means something private, something special, something that is your own, something eccentric. That is the basic meaning of idiocy – to function in an eccentric way. [97]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The mind always functions in an eccentric way; the mind is always an idiot. The really intelligent person has no mind. Intelligence arises out of no-mind, idiocy out of the mind. Mind is idiotic; no-mind is wise. No-mind is wisdom, intelligence. [98]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The mind depends on knowledge, on methods, on money, on experience, on this and that. The mind always needs props, it needs supports; it cannot exist on its own. On its own, it flops. [99]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ultimate effort of the mind to come back will be when you attain to some awareness. It will say, “Look, so we have arrived.” The moment something inside you says, “We have arrived,” beware! Be very, very cautious now, each step has to be of great caution. [100]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Let even the remedy itself go free on its own. Now please don’t cling to the remedy, to the method. This is the emphasis of J. Krishnamurti – but this is his first sutra. It should be the fourth. That’s where he is wrong; it cannot be the first sutra. How can you drop a method that you have never used? You can only drop a method that you have used. [101]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Atisha is far more logical, far more scientific, than J. Krishnamurti, but I can understand why he emphasizes it, because he is afraid that if you go into the first three sutras the fourth may never arrive, you may be lost in the first three. Many are lost in the preliminaries; many are lost in the methods. So he has become too cautious, extremely cautious. [102]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Those five idiots were carrying the boat, and J. Krishnamurti is on the other shore teaching people: “Don’t enter the boat” – too cautious – “because if you enter the boat, who knows, you may start carrying the boat on your head. So please don’t enter it.” [103]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are many who have become afraid of entering the boat, but to be afraid of entering the boat is the same idiocy; there is no difference. One who is afraid of entering the boat is the same person who will carry the boat; otherwise why should you be afraid? [104]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are old friends of mine, who have followed J. Krishnamurti for their whole life. They come to me and say, “We would like to come here, but we are afraid of all the methods that you teach. Methods are dangerous,” they say. [105]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Methods are dangerous only if you are unaware, otherwise they can be used beautifully. Do you think a boat is dangerous? It is dangerous if you are thinking to carry it on your head for your whole life out of sheer gratitude, otherwise it is just a raft to be used and discarded. All methods are rafts to be used and discarded, used and abandoned, used and never looked back at again – there is no need, no point! [106]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These are two extremes. At one extreme are those five idiots, and at the other extreme are the followers of J. Krishnamurti. There is no need to be either. My approach is: use the boat, use beautiful boats, use as many boats as possible, with this awareness, that when the shore is reached the boat is abandoned with no clinging. While you are in the boat enjoy it, be thankful to it. When you get out of the boat, say thank you and move on. [107]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The fifth sutra: [108]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.dk39luf1447s"><span class="c17">Settle in the nature of basic cognition, the essence. [109]</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you drop the remedy, automatically you will start settling in your being. The mind clings; it never allows you to settle in your being. It keeps you interested in something that you are not: the boats. [110]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When you don’t cling to anything, there is nowhere to go – all boats have been abandoned, you cannot go anywhere; all paths have been dropped, you cannot go anywhere; all dreams and desires have disappeared, there is no way to move. Relaxation happens of its own accord. Just think of the word relax. Be, settle, you have come home. [111]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Settle in the nature of basic cognition, the essence. When you settle, there is pure awareness, with no effort, with no method. If awareness needs a method it is still not true awareness, not the essential awareness, not the natural spontaneous awareness. It is still a by-product of the method; it is cultivated, created. It is a by-product of the mind; it is not yet the truth. [112]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">“Settle now in the nature of basic cognition, the essence.” Now there is nothing to do. See, be, enjoy – only this moment exists. This now, this here, this cawing of the crows – and all is silence. [113]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To know this serenity is to know who you are, what this existence is all about. This is samadhi, in the words of Patanjali. This is sambodhi, in the words of Gautam Buddha. This is bodhichitta, in the words of Atisha. [114]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.xuc0r4c8rnq0"><span class="c17">Between sessions, consider phenomena as phantoms. [115]</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now Atisha is really, very aware of the disciple. He knows that these experiences of settling into your being will be only momentary in the beginning. One moment you will find yourself relaxed into your being, another moment it will be gone. In the beginning, it is bound to be so; one moment you are flooded with the unknown, with the mysterious, another moment it is no longer there. One moment all is fragrance, and the next moment you are searching for it and you cannot find where it has gone. [116]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Only glimpses will happen in the beginning. Slowly, slowly they become more and more solid, they abide more and more. Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, very slowly, they settle forever. Before that, you cannot be allowed to take it for granted; that will be a mistake. Hence he says: Between sessions… [117]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When you are sitting in meditation, a session of meditation, this will happen – but it will go. So what are you supposed to do between sessions? Between sessions, consider phenomena as phantoms. Between sessions, continue to use the method. Drop the method when you are deep in meditation. The moment comes, as awareness is getting purer and purer, when suddenly it is utterly pure: drop the method, abandon the method, and forget all about the remedy: just settle and be. [118]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This will happen only for moments in the beginning. Sometimes it happens here listening to me. Just for a moment, like a breeze, you are transported into another world, the world of no-mind. Just for a moment, you know that you know – but only for a moment. Again the darkness gathers and the mind is back with all its dreams, with all its desires and all its stupidities. [119]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For a moment, the clouds had separated and you had seen the sun. Now the clouds are there again: it is all dark and the sun has disappeared. Now even to believe that the sun exists will be difficult. Now, to believe that what you had experienced a moment before was true, will be difficult. It may have been a fantasy; the mind may say it may have just been imagination. [120]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is so incredible, it looks so impossible, that it could have happened to you. With all this stupidity in the mind, with all these clouds and darknesses, it had happened to you: you saw the sun for a moment. It doesn’t look probable – you must have imagined it; maybe you had fallen into a dream and seen it. [121]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In between sessions start again – be in the boat, use the boat again. …consider phenomena as phantoms. [122]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Atisha is very considerate to the disciples; otherwise, the fourth sutra would have been the last – or, at the most, the fifth: Settle in the nature of basic cognition, the essence. [123]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Atisha had been a man like Bodhidharma, the treatise would have finished at the fifth sutra, or even at the fourth: Let even the remedy itself go free on its own. [124]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Between these moments of meditativeness, between these moments of utter joy, emptiness and purity, between these moments of being, remember that all are dreams, that every phenomenon is a phantom. Go on using this method til the settling has happened forever. [126]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.pqgj4kc1e25c"><span class="c17">Train in joining, sending, and taking together.

[128]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now emptiness has been experienced – this is what he had learned. Up to this sutra, he had been with the first master, Dharmakirti. With this sutra, the second master, Dharmarakshita. [129]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Train in joining, sending, and taking together. Do this by riding the breath. Now he says to start being compassionate and the method is, when you breathe in – listen carefully, it is one of the greatest methods. When you breathe in, think that you are breathing in all the miseries of all the people in the world. All the darkness, all the negativity, all the hell that exists anywhere, you are breathing it in. Let it be absorbed in your heart. [130]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You may have read or heard about the so-called positive thinkers of the West. They say just the opposite – they don’t know what they are saying. They say, “When you breathe out, throw out all your misery and negativity; and when you breathe in, breathe in joy, positivity, happiness, cheerfulness.” [131]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Atisha’s method is just the opposite: when you breathe in, breathe in all the misery and suffering of all the beings of the world – past, present and future. And when you breathe out, breathe out all the joy that you have, all the blissfulness that you have, all the benediction that you have. Breathe out, pour yourself into existence. This is the method of compassion: drink in all the suffering and pour out all the blessings. [132]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You will be surprised if you do it. The moment you take all the sufferings of the world inside you, they are no longer sufferings. The heart immediately transforms the energy. The heart is a transforming force: drink in misery, and it is transformed into blissfulness…then pour it out. [133]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Once you have learned that your heart can do this magic, this miracle, you will like to do it again and again.

[134]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Try this beautiful method of compassion: take in all the misery and pour out all the joy. [136]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Train in joining, sending, and taking together.

[139]</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are three objects, which either can function as three poisons or can become three bases of infinite virtue. Atisha is talking of the inner alchemy. The poison can become the nectar; the baser metal can be transformed into gold. [140]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What are these three objects? The first is aversion, the second is attachment, and the third is indifference. This is how the mind functions. You feel aversion to whatsoever you dislike, you feel attachment to whatsoever you like, and you feel indifferent to things which you neither dislike nor like. These are the three objects. Between these three, the mind exists. These are the three legs of the tripod called the mind: aversion, attachment, and indifference. If you live in these three as they are, you are living in poison. [141]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is how we have created a hell out of life. Aversion, dislike, hatred, repulsion – that creates one third of your hell. Attachment, liking, clinging, possessiveness – that creates the second one third of your hell. And indifference to all that you are neither attracted to nor repulsed by – that creates the third part, the third one third of your hell. [142]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just watch your mind; this is how your mind functions. It is always saying, “I like this, I don’t like that, and I am indifferent to the third.” These are the three ways, in which the mind goes on moving. This is the rut, the routine. [143]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Atisha says these are the three poisons, but they can become the three bases of virtue. How can they become three bases of great virtue? If you bring in the quality of compassion, if you learn the art of absorbing suffering, as if all the suffering of the world is coming riding on the breath, then how can you be repulsed? How can you dislike anything, how can you be indifferent to anything, and how can you be attached to anything? If you are unconditionally taking in all the suffering in the world, drinking it, absorbing it in your heart, and then pouring blessings onto the whole of existence unconditionally – and not to somebody in particular, remember – not only to man but to all: to all beings, trees and rocks, and birds and animals; to the whole existence, material, immaterial… when you are pouring out blessings unconditionally, how can you be attached? [144]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Attachment, aversion, indifference: all disappear with this small technique. With their disappearance, the poison is transformed into nectar, and the bondage becomes freedom, and the hell is no longer a hell, it is heaven. [145]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In these moments, you come to know: This very body the buddha, this very earth the lotus paradise. [146]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And the last sutra: [147]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.iuh0r3xt23w1"><span class="c17">Train with phrases in every mode of behavior. [148]</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Atisha is not an escapist. He does not teach escapism, he does not tell you to move from situations which are not to your liking. He says: You have to learn to function in bodhichitta, in buddha-consciousness, in all kinds of situations – in the marketplace, in the monastery; with people in the crowd or alone in a cave; with friends or with enemies; with family, familiar people, and with strangers; with men and with animals. In all kinds of situations, in all kinds of challenges, you have to learn to function in compassion, in meditation – because all these experiences of different situations will make your bodhichitta riper and riper. [149]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Don’t escape from any situation – if you escape, then something will remain missing in you: then your bodhichitta will not be that ripe; will not be that rich. Live life in its multidimensionality! [150]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That’s what I teach you too: Live life in its totality, and living in the world, don’t be of it. Live in the world like a lotus flower in water: it lives in water, but the water touches it not. Only then will bodhichitta flower in you, bloom in you. Only then will you come to know the ultimate consciousness, which is freedom, which is joy, eternal joy, which is benediction. Not to know it is to miss the whole point of life; to know it is the only goal. The only goal – remember it! [151]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Remember, Atisha’s sutras are not philosophical, not speculative not abstract. They are experimental; they are scientific. [152]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Let me repeat again: religion is a science in the sense that it is the purest knowing. Yet it is not a science in the sense of chemistry and physics. It is not the science of the outward; it is the science of the inward. It is not the science of the exterior; it is the science of the interior. It is the science that takes you beyond, it is the science that takes you into the unknown and the unknowable. It is the greatest adventure there is. It is a call and a challenge to all those who have any courage, any guts, any intelligence. [153]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Religion is not for cowards, it is for people who want to live dangerously. [154]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.ak5e9ul5qmid"><span class="c19">Chapter 02</span></h2><h3 class="c9" id="h.x2ihbvey2j4w"><span class="c17">The first question: [0]</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This sounds like a silly question. I am not sure that I want to become enlightened. I am surprised to see so many people around who seem to have that desire. I feel very much attached to my country and I love my work there. Still I want to take sannyas – is that possible? Is it not a contradiction? [2]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All questions are silly and so are all answers. Questions come out of the mind like leaves come out of the trees. Questions are part of the mind that has to be dropped; questions keep the mind nourished. [3]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A question is really a search for food. The answer is the food. The question is a groping: the mind is feeling hungry, it wants to be strengthened; it wants to be fed, it searches for food. Wherever it can find something satisfying… Any answer that makes the mind knowledgeable, that gives the mind the feeling “Now I know,” functions as a food. And the mind can go on and on asking, collecting answers, becoming knowledgeable. [4]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The more knowledgeable the mind is, the more difficult it is to drop it. And it has to be dropped, because unless questioning ceases in you, you will never be silent. Unless questioning disappears totally, you will not find that space, that serenity, that stillness, which can make you aware of who you are, and of what this reality is. [5]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Remember, reality is never going to come to you in the form of an answer. It has never happened that way; it is not going to happen that way. It can’t happen that way, it is not in the nature of things. Reality comes to you when there is no question left; reality comes to an unquestioning state of awareness. [6]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So the first thing to be remembered is: all questions are silly, and all answers are too. Then you will be a little puzzled – why do I go on answering your questions? If you look deep down into my answers, you will see that they are not answers. They don’t nourish your mind, they destroy your mind, they shatter you. They are meant to be shocks. The purpose of my answering is to hammer your mind – it is hammering; it is not answering. [7]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the beginning, when you come here for the first time and you don’t understand me and my purpose, you may think that I am answering you. The longer you are here, the deeper you become attuned with me, the more you know that my answering is not to give you answers. It is not to make you more knowledgeable – just the opposite. It is to take your knowledge away, to make you unknowledgeable, to make you ignorant – ignorant again, innocent again – so that questioning disappears. [8]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And when there is no questioning, there is a totally new quality to your consciousness. That quality is called wonder. Wondering is not questioning, it is feeling mystified by existence. Questioning is an effort to demystify existence, it is an effort not to accept the mystery of life; hence we reduce every mystery to a question. The question means the mystery is only a problem to be solved and once solved, there will be no mystery. [9]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My effort in answering you is not to demystify existence but to mystify it more. Hence my contradictions. I cannot be consistent – I am not answering you. I cannot be consistent, because I am not here to make you more knowledgeable. If I am consistent, you will have a body of knowledge – very satisfying to the mind, nourishing, strengthening, gratifying. [10]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I am deliberately inconsistent, contradictory, so that you cannot make any body of knowledge out of me. So if one day you start gathering something, another day I take it away. I don’t allow you to gather anything. Sooner or later, you are bound to be awakened to the fact that something totally different is transpiring here. It is not that I am giving you some dogma to be believed in, some philosophy to be lived by, no, not at all. I am utterly destructive, I am taking everything away from you. [11]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Slowly, slowly your mind will stop questioning. What is the point? When no answer answers, then what is the point? The day you stop questioning is a day of great rejoicing, because then wondering starts. You have moved into a totally new dimension; you are a child again. [12]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Jesus says: “Unless you are like small children you will not enter into my kingdom of God.” Certainly, he means unless you are ignorant again, innocent again, unquestioning and wondering. [13]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is a difference between the question of a child and a grownup person. The difference is of quality. The child asks not to be answered, he is simply being articulate about his wonder. If you don’t answer the child he forgets about his question and he starts asking another question. His purpose is not to be answered; his purpose is simply that he is talking to himself. He is being articulate about his wonder, he is trying to figure out what it is – the wonder, the mystery. He is not hankering for an answer, so no answer will satisfy him. If you give him an answer, he will ask another question about the answer. His wondering continues. [14]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When a grownup person – educated, sophisticated, well read, informed – asks a question, he asks it out of his knowledge, to gather more knowledge. The mind always hankers for more and more. If you have money, it hankers for more money; if you have prestige, it hankers for more prestige; if you have knowledge, it hankers for more knowledge. The mind lives in the “more.” [15]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is the way you go on and on avoiding reality. Reality is a mystery; it is not a question to be asked. It is a mystery to be lived, a mystery to be experienced, a mystery to be loved – a mystery to be dissolved in, to be drowned in. [16]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I am answering you, not to answer but to simply destroy the question. I am not a teacher. The teacher teaches you; the master does not teach you, he helps you unlearn. [17]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You say, “This sounds like a silly question.” Not only does it sound, it is. All questions are – what can I do? What can you do? [18]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You say, “I am not sure that I want to become enlightened.” That shows how the mind functions, it is never sure of anything. The mind is always unsure; it lives in unsureness. The mind lives in confusion; it can never have any clarity. Clarity is not part of the mind at all; clarity is the absence of the mind, confusion is the presence of the mind. Confusion and mind are synonymous. [19]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You can’t have a clear mind. If you have clarity, you cannot have the mind; if you have the mind, you can’t have clarity. The mind is always divided against itself, it lives in conflict. Divisibility is its nature, hence those who live in the mind never become individuals, indivisibles. They remain divided: one part wants this, and another part wants that. [20]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The mind is a crowd of many desires; it is not a single desire. The mind is multi-psychic, and all the fragments are falling apart in different directions. It is a miracle how we go on keeping ourselves together. It is a hard struggle to keep oneself together. Somehow, we manage, but that togetherness remains only on the surface. Deep down there is turmoil. [21]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You fall in love with a woman; are you sure that you are in love – really sure? I have never come across a lover who is really sure. You may even get married, but are you sure…you may have children, but are you sure that you really wanted to have children? [22]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That’s how you are living: nothing is sure, but one has to do something or other to keep oneself occupied, so you go on keeping yourself occupied. But surety is not of the mind, it cannot be, and the same problem will arise on every level. The same problem is facing you again. [23]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You say, “I am not sure that I want to become enlightened,” but there must be a certain desire, otherwise why the question? A part of your mind must be saying, “Become enlightened” – just a part. Another part must be saying, “Are you mad? Have you lost your senses? You have a wife at home, and children, and work, and you love your country – and you are trying to become enlightened? You must have become a victim of mass hypnosis: so many people in orange, it is dangerous to live with such mad people – so many mad people, enjoying and laughing, and loving and looking so happy! Keep on remembering you have a wife, children, a job. Keep alert!” [24]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But again and again the desire will come. When so many people are interested in enlightenment, there must be something in it. You can deceive one, you can deceive two, but how can you deceive so many…thousands of people interested in enlightenment? It can’t be all bullshit. So a desire arises to have a little taste of it, and fear is there too. [25]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is the situation; always it is so, in everything it is so. You want to purchase a car, and it is the same: whether to purchase a Chevrolet, or a Ford or a Benz? If your wife is not there to help you, you will never purchase any car! Women are more decisive; they are still less in the mind than men. They function out of the heart; their feeling side is still alive. Fortunately, they are not yet so civilized; they are still primitive, a little wild, leaning toward the intuitive and not toward the intellect, still capable and courageous enough to act decisively, to act intuitively, to act illogically. [26]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All decisions come from the heart. The mind is never decisive, it cannot be. If you want to decide through the mind, you never can. I am not talking about great things like enlightenment and the existence of God or the existence of life after death. I am not talking about great things, just small things – whether to purchase this soap or that, or which toothpaste – and you will find the same difficulty. The mind is fragmentary, divided. Hence my consistent insistence that you get out of the mind and start living. The mind only thinks and never lives. It thinks beautiful thoughts, but they are thoughts all the same, just dreams. [27]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Get out of the mind if you want to live. Get out of the mind if you want to live this moment. The mind cannot live in this moment, because it has to decide first, and the moment is lost in thinking, and by the time the mind has decided – if it ever decides – that moment is gone already. You are always lagging behind. The mind is always running after life, and lagging behind and missing it continuously. [28]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Many of you must have dreamed something like this: Anand Maitreya continuously dreams that he is going to catch a train, and in the dream, he always misses it. Many people, I think almost everybody, has dreams of that kind – that you are just going to make it, just going to make it…and you miss it. By the time you reach the platform, the train has left. You see it leaving, but it is too late; you cannot get on it. [29]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Anand Maitreya’s dream is a very significant dream and a universal one. This is simply how the mind functions; this dream symbolizes the mind: it is always missing the train. It is bound to be so, because the mind takes time to think, and time cannot stop for you; it goes on and on slipping out of your hands. [30]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.3iy2ebf340ts"><span class="c17">Either you can live it, or you can think</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You never have two moments together in your hands, only one single moment. It is such a small moment that there is no space for thinking to move, no space for thoughts to exist. Either you can live it, or you can think. To live it is to be enlightened; to think is to miss. [31]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Enlightenment is not a goal that you have to decide whether to accept it or not. It is not a goal. Enlightenment is the realization that we have only the present moment to live. The next moment is not certain – it may come, it may not come. [32]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In fact, tomorrow never comes. It is always arriving and arriving, but never arrives. The mind lives in the tomorrows – and life is possible only in the present. [33]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Jesus says to his disciples, “Look at the lilies in the field, how beautiful they are! Even the great Solomon was not so beautiful attired in all his grandeur as these poor lily flowers.” What is the secret? The secret is that they think not of the morrow. They live now; they live here. [34]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>To live now is to be enlightened, to live here is to be enlightened, to be a lily is to be enlightened this very moment! </span><span class="c5">Don’t think about what I am saying. Don’t think about it, just be here.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is the taste of enlightenment. Once you have tasted it, you will want to taste it more and more. [35]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Don’t make a goal out of it; it is not a goal, it is the most ordinary state of consciousness. </span><span class="c5">It is nothing extraordinary; it is nothing special.</span><span>&nbsp;Trees are enlightened and the birds are enlightened, and rocks are enlightened, and the sun and the moon are enlightened. </span><span class="c5">Only man is not, because only man thinks and goes on missing.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[36]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The moment you realize that you are missing because you are brooding too much, then small glimpses start happening. </span><span class="c5">Small gaps in the traffic of the mind, small gaps when there is no traffic: those are the moments of meditation.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;They can happen anywhere. [37]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yes, in your country too! So, no need to be worried – you need not be in India. India has no copyright on enlightenment: it is not patented yet, it cannot be patented. You can be enlightened anywhere. You can be enlightened remaining a husband, a father, a mother, a wife. You can be enlightened as an engineer, as a doctor, as a carpenter, as a vagabond – even as a hippie. You can be enlightened anywhere. [38]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Enlightenment is not something you have to work for, to strive for. </span><span class="c5">It is something that you have to relax for – not strive, but relax. Relax, and this moment you are enlightened.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Many times you will become enlightened, and many times you will become unenlightened again, just because of the old habit. [39]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>You say, “I am surprised to see so many people around who seem to have that desire.” If they have that desire, they will never become enlightened. </span><span class="c5">Either: you can have the desire, or you can have enlightenment; you can’t have both.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Either: you can eat the cake, or you can have it; you can’t do both. If you have a desire for enlightenment, then enlightenment is never going to happen to you – never, never – because desiring is what prevents it, so enlightenment cannot be desired; that will be a contradiction in terms. [40]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Either: you are enlightened or you are not, it is as simple as that. </span><span class="c5">Enlightenment is not caused by anything</span><span>, it is your nature. </span><span class="c5">Thus, it is not a question of making a great endeavor.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It is not an enterprise; you need not plan for it. It is already the case! [41]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That is Atisha’s first preliminary: Truth is. [42]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Enlightenment is. It is as much as the sunlight showering all around, but you can remain with closed eyes, and you are in a dark night although the sun is showering everywhere. Open your eyes and the night disappears and there is no darkness. Even when you were thinking there was darkness, there was not. It was a very private affair, idiotic; it was something eccentric that you were doing. [43]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To be unenlightened is something that you have earned; great effort has been invested in being unenlightened, and continuously you have to go on making an effort to remain unenlightened. Just drop making any more efforts to remain unenlightened, and you are enlightened. Enlightenment is your natural state; it is what you are. [44]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So please don’t misunderstand my people. Newcomers are certainly desirous; they have come out of desire, in search of something, but those who have been here with me a little longer are no longer in any desire. They are living moment to moment, enjoying the extraordinary ordinariness of life. Small things – sipping hot tea in the morning: you can sip it in an enlightened way, and you can sip it in an unenlightened way. If, sipping hot tea early in the morning, you are not in the moment but thinking of something else – you have to go to the morning discourse – you are unenlightened. You missed an enlightened cup of tea, and remember, if that is your habit, you will miss the discourse too – because this again is nothing but a cup of tea. Then in the discourse, you will be thinking, “I have to do the Sufi meditation, I have to rush to do this and that and then come back.” [45]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is not a question of one moment; it is a question of your pattern, your gestalt. If this is your gestalt, that you are always rushing ahead of time, thinking of the next moment, then you remain unenlightened. And this is your effort, this is something that you are doing. [46]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For enlightenment, nothing has to be done, only this understanding: “Why should I go on keeping myself unenlightened?” [47]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That’s why one day I decided: “Enough is enough. I have lived so many lives in an unenlightened way.” And since then I have lived in an enlightened way. This is simply an understanding; it is not a desire. [48]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You say, “I feel very much attached to my country and love my work there.” Perfectly good! Love your work, love your country, go back – but live there in such a simple moment-to-moment way that you remain enlightened. Don’t lag behind, don’t rush ahead. Just be herenow, wherever you are, whatsoever you are doing. [49]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">“Still,” you say, “I want to take sannyas – is that possible? Is it not a contradiction?” It is a contradiction, but you are living in contradictions, and this is the last contradiction. Before you can come out of your contradictory life, your life of conflict, you have to close the doors of that life. Sannyas is nothing but closing the doors – the last thing. It is simply a declaration that “I have lived in the mind for so long, and nothing but misery has been my experience. Now I am taking a jump out of the mind into the unknown. I am going into a totally different kind of life.” [50]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sannyas is just a gesture from your side that yes, understanding has dawned, and you would like to come closer to me to see what it actually is. [51]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To be close to a master, to be relating to a master, to be intimate with a master, is nothing but an approach toward your own ultimate understanding, your own enlightenment. Your mind will make you very much frightened of the unknown; it will drag you back. And it is always safer to live with the known; it is familiar, you are efficient in living with it. To move into the unknown, you will need a guide – a guide who has moved into the unknown, who lives in the unknown, who lives in innocence. Just to imbibe the spirit you need the guide…not for any guidance, but just to imbibe the spirit of the unknown, the joy of the unknown, the celebration of the unknown. [52]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Once you start drinking something of the master, you will not go back to the old ways of the mind. That’s what sannyas is all about. [53]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yes, you can take sannyas. In the beginning, it is bound to be the same conflict: whether to take it or not, whether to go into it or not. It is natural, because that’s how you have functioned for many lives. This has become your second nature. [54]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I persuade you, I seduce you into sannyas. Great persuasion is needed, great seduction is needed. That’s why I have created sannyas; otherwise there was no need; you could have come here, listened to me, and gone. You would have listened to me, but you would not have come close to me. This is a bridge. You would have heard me, but you would not have tasted of my silence. You would have known what I say about love, but you would not have known my love. [55]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sannyas makes it possible. It is an energy field; it is a buddhafield. It is communion: nonverbal, heart-to-heart, and, one day, being-to-being. [56]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.cayx4bvb0ku3"><span class="c17">The second question: [57]</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why are you so against the mind? Surely we all use it and need it, and it seems to me that it is only when we abuse it – that is to say, using it as a defense against feeling too deeply and against transcending itself – that we are entitled to criticize it. [60]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why do you find it so necessary, so important, for sannyasins to wear orange and a photograph of yourself – in fact a sort of uniform and an icon? If I leave here with a feeling of love and deep respect for a wise man, a healer, I shall not need to carry his photo around with me. His image will be too deeply entrenched in my inner self, and if I need to consult him in my mind, I shall So, don’t decide so soon. You have heard me only once: just be here a little longer, and you will see so many contradictions! Wait a little, give me a little more time, and you will not feel in accord with me at all. In fact, this time too, it was not you feeling in accord with me, but me somehow appearing in accord with you. [64]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You already have great ideas; you are very knowledgeable. Your question is not out of innocence, it is out of knowledge. [65]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So many people are here. I cannot say things which will shatter everybody’s mind. If I say something and it shatters one person’s mind, it may be in accord with somebody else’s mind. For him I will work tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, but sooner or later, the hammer comes down on everybody – and then you will not feel so inspired. In fact, answering your question, I will make you very much uninspired. Wait! [66]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What do you mean by inspiration? It seems you already know something; otherwise, what do you mean by inspiration? What do you mean by accord? You already know something, and you say “Yes, this man is talking sense” – sense, because this is what you have always believed in. [67]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I am not here to support your belief; I have to take your beliefs away. I am not here to inspire you, because all inspiration creates slavery. If you are inspired by me, you will become a slave to me; you will become dependent on me. I don’t inspire you, I simply go on shattering, shocking you. Sooner or later, I am here, you are here and we are tremendously connected, but there is no slavery, no dependence. We relate, but there is no question of inspiration, because one who inspires you automatically becomes important for you – so much so that you start feeling dependent. [68]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>You are searching for a father figure who can inspire you, who can put a little fire in your dull and dead life. </span><span class="c5">But if somebody else puts fire into your life, he becomes powerful over you.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[69]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I am not here to put any fire into you; I am just here to help you to see your own fire. Be a light unto yourself. Inspiration means you will follow somebody else; you will imitate them, you will become a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan. Sannyas is a declaration that you are no longer a Hindu, no longer a Christian, no longer a Mohammedan, that you don’t belong to any creed or any dogma. I have no creed, no dogma. Becoming a sannyasin simply means that you have declared your freedom. [70]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Certainly, the question arises: why the orange, the mala, and the photograph? Why? This is a device, dear lady, to keep unwanted people out. This is not for the crowds, it is not for the mob; it is only for the chosen few. The ultimate – call it godliness, enlightenment – is only for those who are really courageous, immensely courageous – because the ultimate becomes available only to those who can drop the mind and move into the immediate. The immediate is the door to the ultimate. To drop the mind needs great courage – it is not for everybody. [71]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is just a device. Orange is as good as any other color, or no color. It has nothing special about it. I could have chosen any – green, black, that would have done, but its purpose is that it is a device. It is for people who are ready to do a few mad things – because later on, bigger and bigger mad things are waiting. If you cannot do such a simple, silly thing as wearing orange, a locket and a mala, if you can’t gather enough courage to look foolish, a laughingstock wherever you go, and feel absurd and ridiculous – if you cannot do this much, then this place is not for you, because bigger and bigger things will have to be done. [72]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As you move deeper into intimacy with me, I will demand more and more illogical things, because only through those demands can the mind Only then, can your cultivated mind, cultivated for centuries, be shaken to the foundations. [73]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is just a simple device to help freak out people who are not meant to be here. They simply escape. Seeing such a mad crowd, seeing people in orange, they become afraid and they escape. [74]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is deliberately done. I could have made it easier for you to be here, to gather more knowledge, and be inspired, and things like that. But this is not Christian Science. I am not Billy Graham, I am not here to inspire you. This is a totally different phenomenon. In fact, I am not even religious; I am not spiritual at all. All these labels are utterly irrelevant. This is just a device to choose those who are ready to go with me, who are ready to go with me to absurd limits. [75]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But you are cleverer. You say, “I can have you in my heart, entrenched deep in my being” – as if you know what being is and what depth is. You are cunning and clever. You say, “I can conjure you up,” but whatsoever you conjure up will be your own mind, a figment of your own mind; it will not be me, it cannot be me. [76]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You can have me only if you move with me unconditionally. No condition from your side can be accepted. And sometimes I demand things which are patently absurd, and I know that they are absurd. [77]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My people slowly, slowly start understanding that if you can do something absurd, that helps you become a little looser, out of your minds. Once you are unconditionally with me, if I say, “Go and move naked in the streets,” you say, “Okay.” If you can say that, simply and innocently, I am not going to send you to move naked in the streets; the purpose is fulfilled. If you hesitate, if you say, “What do you mean?” then you will have to go. [78]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These are small devices, and sometimes, small devices work very deeply, because you cannot detect them. Big devices you can detect – they are so big, any stupid person can see them. [79]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you are really to relate with a master – who has no knowledge but who knows, who has knowing but no knowledge – then you will have to relax a little. You will have to drop your ideas of how things should be. Remember always, many times it happens: you want to become a sannyasin, but you forget who is the master and who is the disciple, and deep down you start expecting things to be fulfilled by the master. He has to be according to you, then he is right. [87]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But any master worth the name can never be according to you. People who are according to you are politicians. They know that you will follow them only if they are according to you: that is a mutual arrangement. They have to follow you to make followers out of you: that is a mutual exploitation. That’s what political leaders are, followers of the followers. They go on looking at you, at what your expectations are, and they go on fulfilling them. [88]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I offend in every way. I cannot fulfill your expectations. If I start fulfilling your expectations, I will not be of any use to you. Then really you will be the master and I will be the disciple. [89]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Who is taking sannyas from whom? This has to be decided in the beginning. Am I taking sannyas from you, or are you taking sannyas from me? Let it be very clear. Many times you take sannyas and it is not clear, and you want me to be this way or that way, to live this way or to live that way. And if I am not according to you, then you are disappointed. [90]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The real master will always disappoint you. He has to disappoint you. This is how, slowly, slowly, chunks of your mind will be broken off and taken away from you. I have to continuously hammer you, and I have to be absolutely clear about it from the very beginning. The orange, the mala, the picture, have no other purpose. The purpose is that you have to know clearly that it is you who have to be unconditionally in accord with me, and that you have to drop all expectations of my being in accord with you. Only then can the work start. For those who are ready for it, sannyas is only for them. Those who are not ready for it, sannyas helps them to run away, to get lost. [91]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You say, “Why are you so against the mind?” I am not against the mind; I am simply stating the fact – what the mind is. If you see what the mind is, you will drop it. When I say, “Drop the mind,” I am not against the mind. I am simply making it clear to you what the mind is, what it has done to you, how it has become a bondage. [92]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is not a question of using it or abusing it. The mind itself is the problem, not its use or abuse. And remember, you cannot use the mind till you know how to be without the mind. Only people who know how to be without the mind, are capable of using the mind, otherwise the mind uses them. It is the mind that is using you, but mind is very clever, it goes on deceiving you. It goes on saying, “You are using me.” [93]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is the mind that is using you. You are being used; the mind has become the master of you, you are a slave, but the mind is very clever, it goes on buttressing you. It says, “I am just an instrument, you are the master.” But watch, look into the mechanism of the mind, how it goes on using you. You think you are using it. You can use it only when you know that you are separate from it; otherwise how will you use it? You are identified with it. [94]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you say, “I am a Christian,” you are identified with the Christian mind. If you say, “I am a Hindu,” you are identified with the Hindu mind. If you say, “I am German,” you are identified with the German mind. This identification has to be broken. You have to know that you are not the mind. Only in moments when the mind is not functioning – when you are unoccupied, when there is a gap, stillness, silence, when the mind has ceased – will you be able to know whom you are, to know yourself as consciousness. Then you can use the mind. [95]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I am using the mind, you are not using the mind. So how can I be against the mind? I am not against the mind. I may appear to be, but the whole effort is to disconnect you from the mind so that you can know your separation from it, your freedom. Once you know your freedom, you can use the mind. Then it is a beautiful instrument, one of the most beautiful instruments. Man has not yet been able to make something better. Even the biggest computer, the most efficient computer, is not yet capable of doing the things that the mind can do. A single mind can contain all the libraries of the world. [96]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is tremendous to think of the powers of the mind, but because those powers are great, there is danger also: they can overpower you. That’s what has happened: because the mind is such a beautiful, powerful instrument, you have become possessed by it. You cannot use it anymore. It uses you, it directs you, it gives you programs. It goes on goading you in directions which it has decided to follow. It does not allow you any freedom, it does not leave you any choice. Unless it is convinced, it won’t allow you to move even a single inch. [97]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So who is the master? You cannot be the master unless you have come to know that you are not identified with the mind. [98]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The man who is identified with his car cannot drive it; the car will drive him, and then some accident is bound to happen. You have to be separate from the car; you have to know that you are separate, that the car is beautiful, a beautiful mechanism to be used, and it can perform many things. But you have to be separate. [99]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You say, “Why are you so against the mind? Surely we all use it.” No. All cannot use it. Only very rarely is there a person who uses the mind: a Buddha, a Jesus, an Atisha, a Tilopa – only very rarely, and few and far between; otherwise you are used by the mind. No, all are not using the mind; otherwise what will the difference be between a Buddha and you? There will be no difference. You use the mind and Buddha uses the mind – what is the difference? Buddha uses the mind; you are used by the mind – that’s the difference. Buddha can use the mind because he knows he is utterly separate. [100]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Remember, it is not a question of abuse. If you cannot use the mind, how can you abuse it? It is the mind; whether it uses you or abuses you, you cannot abuse it. [101]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When scientists discovered atomic energy, do you think they used the mind, or abused it? When the atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Albert Einstein could not sleep the whole night; for days, his nights were disturbed. He could not sleep, he could not rest; he was really terribly disturbed. He had been instrumental in creating the atom bomb. It was he himself who wrote the letter to the president of America, saying that the atom bomb was possible. [102]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now the question arises: was Einstein consciously using his mind writing the letter to the president of America releasing this powerful information to the politicians? Was he aware of the consequences? Did he ever think of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – that thousands of people, innocent civilians, would be burned within seconds, for no fault of their own. No, he had not thought about it, he was not conscious of it. In fact, he was not even alert to what use atom bombs would be put. Before he died, somebody asked him, “If you are born again, what would you like to be? A great mathematician again, a great physicist, a great scientist?” [103]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He is reported to have said, “No, never! Rather, I would like to be a plumber. But now it is too late.” [104]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Einstein had one of the most beautiful minds. Did he abuse it? Do you think the scientists who have created great technology and destroyed the whole ecology of the earth, used their minds or abused them? [105]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If one day this planet earth is going to die, it will be because of the great minds of the twentieth century – because if in the whole history of humanity there have been a hundred scientists, ninety-nine happen to be alive in the twentieth century. In fact, seventy-five percent of the great scientists of all the ages are alive now. [106]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The mind has gathered such a great momentum. We have created great technology within the last hundred years, particularly within these last ten years, but that technology is going to destroy this earth. Who will be responsible? What will you say? The scientists used the mind or abused it? [107]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you ask me, I will say they were not masters of their minds. They neither used nor abused the mind; the mind used them, abused them. [108]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Science now needs great meditators; otherwise, this earth is doomed. Science now needs people who can use their minds, who are masters of their being, who can use science in a conscious way. Otherwise, we are on the verge of committing universal suicide. [109]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Man cannot live for more than twenty-five years the way he has lived up to now, unless a drastic change is made. And the greatest thing that can be of help, which can help humanity to survive, and the earth to still go on living…and this is a beautiful earth. Compared to this earth millions and millions of stars are just dead: no flowers bloom, no rivers flow, there are no birds, no animals, no people. This universe is almost a great desert. This earth is alive! Something tremendously important: consciousness has happened here, but this consciousness is still not a master, it is a slave. It has to be freed. [110]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That’s my work here, my basic fundamental work: to help you be free of the mind so that you can use it. If you are the master, you cannot abuse it; that is impossible. When you are alert, conscious, meditative, abuse is not possible. [111]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Einstein had also been a buddha, there would have been atomic energy but no atom bombs, and atomic energy would have become a blessing – the greatest blessing ever. The earth would have become a paradise, but Albert Einstein was not a buddha; unfortunately he knew nothing of meditation – a great mind, but the master was missing; a great mechanism, a great airplane without the pilot. [112]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Great science is there, a by-product of the mind, but it is in the hands of slaves. Buddhas are needed to take possession of humanity – and one or two buddhas won’t do. Many, many buddhas are needed in every field, in every direction, in every dimension of life, so that the mind can be used. Otherwise, the mind was never as efficient as it is now, and that is the danger. The mind was never as clever as it is now, never as powerful as it is now. [114]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We have given atom bombs into the hands of children. If no accident happens, that will be a miracle. There is every possibility that an accident is bound to happen. Children are playing with atom bombs. [115]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Politicians are the most immature minds in the world. Only third-rate minds become interested in politics: mediocre people and people who are suffering from an inferiority complex, they become politicians. In these people’s hands are atom bombs, hydrogen bombs, laser beams, and this and that. [116]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You can cease at any moment! I may not be able to finish my discourse. Any moment…we are sitting on a pile of hydrogen bombs, and there are so many…it is unbelievable how stupid man can be. We have so many hydrogen bombs that we can destroy every single human being seven hundred times. Now, what stupidity! For what? A man simply dies a single time. If you want to be very cautious, twice will do – but what is the point of seven hundred times? And they are continuously creating more and more. The whole earth is full of hydrogen bombs; we can destroy seven hundred earths like this. Still seventy percent of our energy is being put into war efforts. This whole earth seems to be a madhouse. [117]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You say, “Surely we all use it and need it and it seems to me that it is only when we abuse it – that is to say, using it as a defense against feeling too deeply and against transcending itself – that we are entitled to criticize it.” I am not criticizing it. In fact, you will be able to appreciate it more if you understand what I am saying, you will be able to use it more if you understand what I am saying. If you become a transcendence of the mind, a witness to the mind, and you know that you are separate, and the mind no longer has any sway over you, you are no longer hypnotized by it, you will be able to really appreciate it. I appreciate it. And you will also be able to use it, and you will never be able to abuse it. A conscious person cannot abuse anything. [118]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.1els1gkdkrys"><span class="c17">The last question: [119]</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I have noticed that when I see a woman who is particularly lovely, and I am taken into that sweet silence, I forget all about philosophy or religion, but I am lost and found entering a moment. I think animals are wise because God doesn't trouble them with metaphysics. Still, I want to throw my books out…but still I like them. [121]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A woman is metaphysics, philosophy, poetry. So is a man. Certainly, one will forget metaphysics and philosophy when one comes across alive metaphysics, alive philosophy, alive poetry. That simply shows that you are still alive. To appreciate beauty, to be drowned and drunk with it, is something immensely valuable. [122]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There would have been something wrong if, seeing a beautiful woman, you still remembered the Old Testament, or the Bhagavadgita or the Koran. That would have shown that something is wrong with you. This simply shows you are natural, human. [123]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Let this sensitivity grow, and slowly, slowly, as you become more and more sensitive, more and more sensuous, you will see more and more beauty around. The deeper is your insight, the greater the beauty. And when you see this whole existence as a tremendous dance, a celebration, you are liberated by it. [124]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is celebration that liberates, it is love that liberates, it is beauty that liberates – it is not metaphysics or philosophy. [125]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, I am not saying that you have to throw your books out – because there are beautiful books too; they are by-products of great experiences. Don’t be lost in them, but to read something of Shakespeare or Kalidas or to read something from Buddha or Atisha is to move into the same world of beauty from a different door. [126]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are many doors to the temple of godliness. Beauty is one, wisdom is another, love still another, and so on and so forth. Music can do it, poetry can do it, literature can do it. The flowers on the trees are beautiful – what do you think of great poems? They are flowers of consciousness. [127]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You need not throw away your books. In fact, by throwing away your books, you will simply be saying that you are still attached to them. Hate is nothing but love standing on its head, love doing sirshsasana, a headstand. Love and hate are not separate, they are one. In fact, we should stop using these two words separately; we should make one word: lovehate. Not even a hyphen is needed between the two; they are simply one energy like hot and cold, summer and winter, life and death, darkness and light. [128]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no need to throw away your books – enjoy them! There is no need to stop enjoying the beautiful form of a woman, because that too is divine. Enjoy life in all its dimensions. Why this continuous obsession to become one-dimensional: either this or that? Why not both? Why live in either/or? Why not live in both/and? That’s my approach: live in both/and, and drop living in either/or. [129]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no need to choose – why not live choicelessly? Why not live all that life makes available to you? Don’t be a spiritualist and don’t be a materialist: be both. Don’t be a Zorba and don’t be a Buddha; be both: Zorba the Buddha. Enjoy all that existence has showered on you. [134]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That’s my message to my sannyasins. You are not yet my sannyasin, but if you start living in totality, accepting all, giving each moment its due, respecting all, and when a beautiful woman passes suddenly you are thrilled, that shows you are alive, that you are not dead yet. [135]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But this need not be just a sexual stirring in you – that is very poor. It has to be something more; it can be a spiritual stirring too. I am not against sex, but to live only a sexual life is to live life at the minimum. Why not live the whole spectrum of it, from sex to samadhi? [136]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When a really beautiful woman passes by, if only your sexuality is stirred, then the animal is alive but you are not. But if your spirituality is also stirred, then you are alive in your totality. And to be alive in totality is the way to godliness. [137]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></div>
