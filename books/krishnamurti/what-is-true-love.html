  What is true love? <br>
  KRISHNAMURTI:
</p>
<p>
  When you talk about ‘true’ love, it means that there must be ‘false’ love; and is there? If you love, can it be called either true or false? Just look at the question you have raised, and see the implications of the words that you have used. You have an idea of what is false and what is true love, which means that your mind has already put itself in a framework, enclosed itself behind a wall and, therefore, you will never find out what love is. So the important thing, surely, is not to think in terms of false and true love, but to find out what love is. 
</p>
<p>Now, what is love? What is this astonishing thing that man is crying for? You want to find it, feel it, enjoy it, to be companionable and to live with it, don’t you? And to do that you must not be satisfied with mere words. The word is not the thing. The word ‘love’ is not love. So you must see, very clearly, the difference between the word and the fact. The first thing that we must understand deeply is that the word is never the thing. My name is just a word; it is obviously not me. So, in everything, we must be very careful never to mix the word with the thing, but to keep the two apart. With this clearly in mind, let us proceed. 
</p>
<p>We want to find out what love is. How are we to do it? First of all, we must remove from the word itself all the things that people have piled upon it. Do you understand? We must remove all the ideas, opinions and expressions which have come to be associated with the word ‘love’: what the saints have said about it, what is written in the religious books, what our parents and other people have told us about it. 
</p>
<p>‘If you love me, you will follow me.’ ‘If you love me, you will do your duty.’ These and many other concepts have been piled on top of the word ‘love’. We have to begin by clearing all that away. To sweep away all the things that people—it does not matter who, including the speaker—have said about love is the first thing to do, for then alone can we begin to find out. 
</p>
<p>Now, when you are fully aware of the fact that the word ‘love’ is not love, and have put away from you everything that has been said and written about it, you will see that love is not jealousy. Do you understand? Where there is jealousy, there can be no love. Jealousy implies hate, pride, envy, and these things have nothing whatsoever to do with love. If you are jealous, competitive, ambitious, envious, you will never know what love is. 
</p>
<p>Politicians and saints may talk about love, but the moment they have ambition, envy, conflict, they will have no love. So, if you really want to find out what love is, you have to eliminate from your mind all jealousy, envy, competition, ambition, pride; and there must be no fear. Fear of public opinion, fear of being stupid, of not being a great man, fear of people who are supposed to be marvellously intelligent, fear of tomorrow, fear of death—all these fears must go if you want to find out what 
  love is. 
</p>
<p>Also, to find out what love is, the mind must be free of sorrow—sorrow at losing someone whom we say that we love. We think we love another but we don’t, because the moment we lose that person, we are full of tears. To love is to have no sorrow, no fear, no desire for fame. And love is really a most extraordinary thing, because without it life becomes very dull, mechanical, 
  ugly—and that is how most of us live. We live in darkness and die in darkness, because we have never really felt this quality of love. Do not depend on my words, but be this thing. What matters is what you are. 
</p>
<p>Each one of us has to discover for oneself what love is, and that means observing and understanding all the time, every minute of the day, this strange, complex thing called life.
