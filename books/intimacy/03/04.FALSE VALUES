FALSE VALUES

One very fundamental thing has to be remembered: Man is very clever in creating false
values. The real values demand your totality, demand your whole being; the false values are
very cheap. They look like the real, but they don't demand your totality—just a superficial
formality.
        For example, in place of love, trust, we have created a false value, "loyalty." The loyal
person is only superficially concerned with love. He goes through all the gestures of love,
but he means nothing by them; his heart stays out of his formal gestures.
        A slave is loyal—but do you think anybody who is a slave, who has been reduced in his
humanity, whose whole pride and dignity have been taken away, can love the person who
has harmed him so deeply? He hates him, and if the chance arises, he will kill him! But on
the surface he will remain loyal—he has to. It is not out of joy, it is out of fear. It is not out
of love, it is out of a conditioned mind that says you have to be loyal to your master. It is the
loyalty of the dog to his master.
        Love needs a more total response. It comes not out of duty but out of your own
heartbeats, out of your own experience of joy, out of the desire to share it. Loyalty is
something ugly. But for thousands of years it has been a very respectable value because
society has enslaved people in different ways. The wife is supposed to be loyal to the
husband—to the point that in India millions of women have died with their husband's death,
jumping onto the funeral pyre and burning to death. It was so respectable that any woman
who would not do it had to live a very condemned life. She became almost an outcast; she
was treated only as a

servant in her own family. It was concluded that because she could not die with her husband,
she was not loyal to him.
     In fact, just think of it the other way around: Not a single man has jumped onto his
wife's funeral pyre! Nobody has raised the question, "Does that mean that no husband has
ever been loyal to his wife?" But it is a society of double standards. One standard is for the
master, the owner, the possessor, and the other standard is for the slave.
     Love is a dangerous experience because you are possessed by something that is bigger
than you. And it is not controllable; you cannot produce it on order. Once it is gone, there is
no way to bring it back. All that you can do is to pretend, be a hypocrite.
     Loyalty is a totally different matter. It is manufactured by your own mind, it is not
something beyond you. It is a training in a particular culture, just like any other training. You
start acting, and by and by you start believing your own acting. Loyalty demands that you
should always, in life or in death, be devoted to the person whether your heart is willing for it
or not. It is a psychological way of enslavement.
     Love brings freedom. Loyalty brings slavery.
On the surface they look alike; deep down, they are
just the opposite, diametrically opposite. Loyalty is
acting; you have been educated for it. Love is wild;
its whole beauty is in its wildness. It comes like a
breeze with great fragrance, fills your heart, and
suddenly where there was a desert there is a garden
full of flowers. But you don't know from where it
comes, and you don't know that there is no way to
bring it. It comes

on its own and remains as long as existence wills it. And just as it had come one day, as a
stranger, as a guest, suddenly one day it is gone. There is no way to cling to it, no way to
hold it.
     Society cannot depend on such unpredictable, unreliable experiences. It wants
guarantees, securities; hence it has removed love from life completely and it has put marriage
in its place. Marriage knows loyalty, loyalty to the husband, and because it is formal, it is
within your hands . . . but it is nothing compared to love—it is not even a dewdrop in the
ocean that love is.
                                          But society is very happy with it because it is
                                    reliable. The husband can trust you, trust that tomorrow,
                                    too, you will be as loyal as you are today. Love cannot be
                                    trusted—and the strangest phenomenon is that love is the
                                    greatest trust but it cannot be trusted. In the moment it is
                                    total, but the next moment remains open. It may grow
                                    within you; it may evaporate from you. The husband
                                    wants a wife who is a slave for her whole life. He cannot
                                    depend on love; he has to create something looking like
                                    love but manufactured by man's mind.
      It is not only in the relationship of love but also in other fields of life that loyalty has
been given great respect. But it destroys intelligence. The soldier has to be loyal to the
nation. The man who dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki—you cannot call him
responsible; he was simply fulfilling his duty. He was ordered, and he was loyal to his supe-
riors; that is the whole training of armies. For years they train you so that you become almost
incapable of revolt. Even if you see that what is be-

ing asked from you is absolutely wrong, still your training has gone so deep you will
say, "Yes, sir, I will do it."
     I cannot conceive that the man who dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki was a machine. He also had a heart, just like you. He also had his wife and
children, his old mother and father. He was as much a human being as you are—with
a difference. He was trained to follow orders without questioning, and when the order
was given, he simply followed it.
     I have thought again and again about his mind.
Is it conceivable that he did not think that this bomb
would destroy almost two hundred thousand people?
Could he not have said, "No! Is it not better to be
shot by the general for not following the order than
to kill two hundred thousand people"? Perhaps the
idea never occurred to him.
     The army works in such a way as to create
loyalty; it starts with small things. One wonders why
every soldier for years has to do parades and follow
stupid orders—left turn, right turn, go backward, go
forward—for hours, for no purpose at all. But there
is a hidden purpose in it. His intelligence is being
destroyed. He is being turned into an automaton, into
a robot. So when the order comes, "Left turn," the
mind does not ask why. If somebody else says to
you, "Left turn," you are going to ask, "What
nonsense is this? Why should I turn left? I'm

going right!" But the soldier is not supposed to doubt, to inquire; he simply has to follow.
This is his basic conditioning for loyalty.
                                              It is good for the kings and for the generals that
                                      armies should be loyal to the point that they function
                                      like machines, not like men. It is comfortable for parents
                                      that their children are loyal because a child who is a
                                      rebel is a problem. The parents may be wrong, and the
                                      child may be right, but he has to be obedient to the
                                      parents; that is part of the training of the old man that
                                      has existed up to now.
                                              I teach you the new human being in whom loyalty
                                      has no place but who has instead intelligence, inquiry, a
                                      capacity to say no. To me, unless you are capable of
                                      saying no, your yes is meaningless. Your yes is just
                                      recorded on a gramophone record; you cannot do
                                      anything, you have to say yes because the no simply
                                      does not arise in you.
                                              Life and civilization would have been totally
                                      different if we had trained people to have more
intelligence. So many wars would not have happened because people would have asked,
"What is the reason? Why should we kill people, people who are innocent?" But they are
loyal to one country and you are loyal to another country, and both the countries' politicians
are fighting and sacrificing their people. If the politicians love to fight so much, they can
have a wrestling match, and people can enjoy it just like any football match.
     But the kings and the politicians, the presidents and the prime

ministers don't go to war. The simple people, who have
nothing to do with killing others, go to war to kill and to be
killed. They are rewarded for their loyalty—they are given
the Victoria Cross or other kinds of awards for being in-
human, for being unintelligent, for being mechanical.
     Loyalty is nothing but the combination of all these
diseases—belief,    duty,    respectability.   They   all   are
nourishment for your ego. They are all against your
spiritual growth, but they are in favor of the vested
interests. The priests don't want you to ask any question about their belief system because
they know that they have no answers to give. All belief systems are so false that if
questioned, they will fall down. Unquestioned, they create great religions with millions of
people in their folds.
     Now, the pope has millions of people under him, and out of these millions of people, not
a single one inquires, "How can a virgin girl give birth to a child?" That would be
sacrilegious! Out of millions of people not a single one asks, "What is the evidence that Jesus
is the only begotten Son of God? Anybody can claim it. What is the evidence that Jesus has
saved people from misery? He could not save himself." But questions like these are
embarrassing, and they are simply not raised. Even God is nothing but a hypothesis, which
religious people have been trying to prove for thousands of years ... all kinds of proofs but all
bogus, with no substance, no support from existence. But nobody asks the question.
     From the very first day of life people are being trained to be loyal to the belief system
in which they were born. It is convenient for the priests to exploit you, it is convenient for
the politicians to exploit

you, it is convenient for husbands to exploit wives, for parents to exploit children, for
teachers to exploit students. For every vested interest, loyalty is simply a necessity. But it
reduces the whole of humanity into retardedness. It does not allow questioning. It does not
allow doubt. It does not allow people to be intelligent. And a man who is not capable of
doubting, of questioning, of saying "No" when he feels that the thing is wrong has fallen
below humanity, has become a subhuman animal.
     If love is asked, then it becomes loyalty. If love is given without being asked, it is your
free gift. Then it raises your consciousness. If trust is asked, you are being enslaved. But if a
trust arises in you, something superhuman is growing within your heart. The difference is
very small but of tremendous importance: asked or ordered, love and trust both become false.
When they arise on their own, they have immense intrinsic value. They do not make you a
slave, they make you a master of yourself because it is your love, it is your trust. You are
following your own heart. You are not following somebody else. You are not being forced to
follow. Out of your freedom is your love. Out of your dignity is your trust—and they are
both going to make you richer human beings.
     That is my idea of the new humanity. People will love, but they will not allow love to
be ordered. They will trust, but they will trust according to themselves—not according to
any scriptures, not according to any social structure, not according to any priest, not
according to any politician.

To live your life according to your own heart, following its beat, going into the unknown just like an eagle flying across the sun in utter freedom, knowing no limits ... it is not ordered. It is its own joy. It is the exercise of one's own spirituality.
