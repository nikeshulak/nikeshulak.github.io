LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF SILENCE

You have always remained just casually related, and when you are formally related to someone, you can go on chattering about a thousand and one nonsensical things because nothing matters—it is just a pastime.
                                
But when you start feeling closer to someone and an intimacy arises, then even a single word that you utter matters. Then you cannot play so easily with words because now everything is meaningful. So there will be gaps of silence. One feels awkward in the beginning because one is not accustomed to silence. One thinks something must be said, otherwise what will the other think?

Whenever you grow close, whenever there is some sort of love, silence comes, and there is nothing to say. In fact, there is nothing to say—there is nothing. With a stranger there is much to say; with friends, nothing to say. And the silence becomes heavy because you are not accustomed to it.

You don't know what the music of silence is. You know only one way of communicating, and that is verbal, through the mind. You don't know how to communicate through the heart, heart-to-heart, in silence. You don't know how to communicate by just being there, through your presence. You are growing, and the old pattern of communication is falling short. You will have to grow new patterns of communication, nonverbal. The more mature one becomes, the more nonverbal communication is needed.

Language is needed because we don't know how to communicate. When we know how to, by and by, language is not needed. Language is just a very primary-school medium. The real medium is of silence. So don't take a wrong attitude, otherwise you will stop growing. Nothing is missing when language starts to disappear; this is a wrong idea. Something new has come into being and the old pattern is not enough to contain it. You are growing, and your dresses are becoming short. It is not that something is missing; something is being added to you every day.

The more you meditate, the more you will love, and the more you will relate. And finally one comes to a moment when only silence helps. So next time when you are with somebody and you are not communicating with words, and you are feeling very uneasy, feel happy. Become silent and allow that silence to communicate.

Language is needed to relate to people with whom you have no love relationship. Nonlanguage is needed for people with whom you have a love relationship. One has to become innocent again, like a child, and silent. Gestures will be there—sometimes you will smile and hold hands, or sometimes you will just remain silent, looking into each other's eyes, not doing anything, just being. The presences meet and merge, and something happens which only you will know. Only you to whom it has happened—no one else will become aware, it happens in such depth.

Enjoy that silence; feel and taste and savor it. Soon you will see that it has its own communication; that it is greater and higher and deeper and more profound. And that communication is sacred; it has a purity about it.
